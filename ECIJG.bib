	abstract = {Standard material requirement planning (MRP) systems do not include the purchasing decisions associated with business rules and containerisation strategies, in order to make decisions in a more holistic model and to seek an improvement in the planning process. This paper proposes a mathematical MRP-C model with containerisation constraints based on mixed integer linear programming, whose objective is to minimise total operating costs. The methodology structures a decision-making system with an integrated supply chain approach, which means that decisions impact on the different agents. The findings show a comparative result with data from a real system and a sensitivity analysis with other scenarios. The research suggests future avenues by including uncertainty and nervousness analysis, service level constraints and lost sales costs in the model and the robust optimization approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Operational Research Society of India 2024.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the scale effects on the experimental shear strength of earthen walls, a critical parameter influencing the seismic performance of adobe and rammed-earth (RE) buildings. Recognized for their historical significance and sustainable construction practices, earthen structures require a comprehensive understanding of their mechanical behavior under shear loads to ensure effective design and preservation. This research compiles data from over 120 in-plane shear wall tests (adobe and RE), nearly 20 direct shear tests from the scientific and technical literature, and new cyclic direct shear tests performed on large cubic specimens (300 mm side length) made from the same material as a previously tested two-story RE wall. Based on the findings, this study recommends a minimum specimen cross-sectional area of 0.5 m2 for reliable shear strength testing of earthen walls in structural laboratories. This recommendation aims to prevent the unconservative overestimation of shear strength commonly observed in smaller specimens, including direct shear tests. Furthermore, the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion outlined in the AIS-610 Colombian standard is validated as a conservative lower bound for all compiled shear strength data. Cyclic direct shear tests on nine 300 mm cubic specimens produced a Mohr–Coulomb envelope with an apparent cohesion of 0.0715 MPa and a slope of 0.66, whereas the full-scale two-story wall (5.95 × 6.20 × 0.65 m) constructed with the same material exhibited a much lower cohesion of 0.0139 MPa and a slope of 0.26. The analysis reveals significant scale effects, as small-scale specimens consistently overestimate shear strength due to their inability to capture macro-structural behaviors such as compaction layer interactions, construction joint weaknesses, and stress redistributions. Based on the analysis of the compiled data, the novelty of this study lies in defining a strength reduction factor for direct shear tests (3.4–3.8 for rammed earth, ~3.0 for adobe) to align with full-scale wall behavior, as well as establishing a minimum specimen size (≥0.5 m2) for reliable in-plane shear testing of earthen walls, ensuring accurate structural assessments of shear strength. This study provides a first approach to the shear behavior of unstabilized earth. To expand its application, future research should explore how the scale of specimens with different stabilizers affects their shear strength. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Diatomaceous soil deposits have been found in different parts of the world. However, until recently, its applications only existed in the field of agricultural engineering and agronomy. Within geotechnical engineering, there are still few studies on the subject. In this context, the advances found in the literature highlight that these materials are characterized by presenting geotechnical responses different from those dictated by traditional soil mechanics. One of the points of interest is related to the high values of resistance to shear that they can present, even when they are within clay matrices. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the behavior of these deposits so that the physical and mechanical responses can be known in detail when subjected to stresses transmitted by a foundation structure. Thus, this study employs reduced-scale models installed in a small diameter geotechnical centrifuge. The load and displacement trajectories of shallow and deep foundations in artificial soils built from a kaolin base with different dosages diatomaceous soils of different genesis are presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Geotechnical Society.},

The findings revealed that cities in the Caribbean regions exhibited lower TMI values, attributed to reduced rainfall and increased temperatures.

With the additional allocation of a spectrum between 12.75 and 13.25 GHz, the satellite industry will be able to meet this need for additional capacity; however, the band must be harmonized because there are already assigned primary services that need to be protected against interference. This article presents the study and evaluation of the spectrum sharing and compatibility of the fixed (primary) satellite services allocated to the frequency band from 12.75 to 13.25 GHz with the mobile (secondary) satellite services to onboard aircraft and vessels (ETEM); Following resolution 172 of the WRC-23 (World Radiocommunication Conference 2023) agenda, both services communicate with GSO (Geostationary Satellite Orbit) space stations through an uplink. The methodology started with the investigation of the technical specifications and characteristics of each service for the case study of Colombia, which is in region 2; then, three interference scenarios between the mentioned satellite services were identified and selected; Subsequently, a study was made of the places (Colombian cities) where cases of interference between these services may occur. Finally, the parameters to evaluate the interference were established, and it was simulated in SEAMCAT® to collect the values of the parameters of interest and make an analysis of the results obtained. These allow concluding coexistence without interference if coordination distances of 50 km, or more are met between ETEM and FSS (Fixed Satellite Service) earth stations in the uplink. Another requirement is that the transmission bandwidths must be a maximum of 7 MHz. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Besides its primary use for making sculptures, the modeling clay is commonly used to evaluate bulletproof vests and simulate metal manufacturing processes by conformation. In ballistic tests, the clay is used to retain the deformation of the rear face of body armors; and in the study of metal forming processes, it is used as a physical model to provide information on the plastic flow. However, its mechanical dynamic behavior is not entirely understood. In this study, Plastilina Roma No. 1 modeling clay was mechanically characterized using the power-law constitutive model at medium strain rates (Formula presented.). The material parameters were determined using a penetration model based on the Cavity Expansion Theory and an inverse technique involving the comparison of the model with experimentation. The optimum set of constitutive parameters was found by reducing the difference of the calculated penetration profile and the measurements from a drop test. This optimization process was programmed on the MATLAB–Simulink environment. The determined material parameters were validated by comparing the results from a computational model with three test set-ups. Finite element model results show good concordance with experimental measurements. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {This research presents a case study focusing on the design and evaluation of a microgrid tailored for a residential community in Bogota, Colombia. The microgrid incorporates a communications architecture compliant with the IEC 61850 Standard, facilitating effective management of information within the system. The study evaluates the performance of the commu-nication network under normal operating conditions and a sim-ulated failure scenario. The proposed communications network considers the configuration and physical layout of control and protection (C&P) equipment. The architecture based on High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) topology, incorporates three VLANs for data organization. Simulation using CISCO Packet Tracer assesses the performance of control, metering, and protection systems. Evaluation results demonstrate maximum transmission times within the control and protection systems, with a fault clearing time of 49 ms observed in the case study. The relative simplicity of the network architecture and its advantages underscore the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The growing integration of renewable energy sources and the electrification of multiple sectors have heightened the need for optimized planning and operation of modern electrical distribution systems. A critical challenge for distribution network operators is enhancing the resilience and reliability of their grids by identifying effective solutions. One promising approach to achieving this is through the deployment of battery energy storage systems, which can rapidly inject power to mitigate the impacts of network disturbances or outages. This study investigates the use of advanced genetic algorithms as a practical methodology for the optimal siting of batteries in modern distribution networks. By incorporating historical data on demand and network failures, the algorithm generates statistical models that inform the optimization process. The model integrates both the technical and economic aspects of battery systems to identify locations that minimize reliability indices such as SAIDI and SAIFI, while also reducing investment costs. Tested on a real distribution system comprising 1837 nodes, the proposed approach demonstrates the ability of genetic optimization to deliver efficient solutions compared with traditional methods, providing a high likelihood of identifying strategic battery locations that respond to variable demand, system failures, and technical constraints. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, products are available to improve the performance of reinforced concrete elements, such as short fibers, which are available in different geometries and aspect ratios. However, the regulations and standards for building construction do not allow its use in elements of the seismic resistance system. Therefore, a composite material called SFRC (steel fiber reinforced concrete) is being widely used in slabs, shells, or coatings as reinforcement to replace welded wire meshes or as a control system for shrinkage and pressure cracks in tunnels. For this research, SFRC specimens were manufactured using two different steel fiber aspect ratios. Compression and tensile tests were made to evaluate the capacity of the composite matrix to dissipate energy outside the elastic range, and the complete stress-strain curve was obtained for all tested specimens. Also, 3-m-long beams were fabricated using the concrete mixture with longitudinal (flexural) reinforcement and tested as four-point bending beams. In this case, using the deflection in the middle spam were calculated the entire bending moment vs. slope curves. As a result, the SFRC characteristic curves for normal stress (tensile and compression) as well as for bending moment were obtained. The ductility was calculated and compared with theoretical models proposed in the literature to describe the behavior of SFRC concrete in bending. Results show that the use of steel fibers in concrete mixtures increases energy dissipation and a controlled ductile failure for beams with flexural reinforcing bars without shear stirrups, being viable the possibility of including this type of reinforcement with fibers in elements with a demand for energy dissipation due to earthquakes. © 2024 IABSE Congress San Jose 2024: Beyond Structural Engineering in a Changing World - Report.

Robotic exoskeletons, in particular, have shown promise for enhancing mobility and independence in patients with conditions such as stroke. Current exoskeleton designs, however, often lack the necessary degrees of freedom (DOFs) to provide adequate balance and support during activities of daily living (ADLs), such as walking and standing. This study proposes a new lower limb exoskeleton design incorporating a variable stiffness hip joint based on a four-bar mechanism. This joint provides additional DOFs for improved balance and stability during gait, making it easier for patients to perform ADLs. The results show that the exoskeleton effectively improves stability during gait testing. This suggests that the proposed design can greatly enhance mobility and independence in impaired patients and could be a valuable tool in rehabilitation robotics. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the challenge of improving prosthetic control through the analysis of electromyographic (sEMG) signals and gesture recognition. Using the Ninapro database [1] containing EMG signals from 10 subjects performing 17 different movements, focusing on recognizing 12 specific gestures. Each gesture was repeated six times per subject, resulting in a robust dataset for analysis. The methodology employed a combination of statistical techniques, arithmetic operations and Fourier transformations to preprocess and analyze the EMG signals. Various machine learning (ML) models were evaluated, with the RandomForest classifier achieving the highest accuracy at 20.8%, while other classifiers like KNeighbors, GaussianNB, SVM(Support Vector Machines), and MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptrons) showed lower performance. To improve the results, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied, but it only resulted in marginal improvements. Given the limitations of traditional ML methods, the EMG signals were converted into grayscale images and applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency domain analysis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on these images, achieving a high accuracy of 95% in gesture recognition. The CNN's performance underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) techniques in capturing complex patterns in sEMG signals, leading to significant improvements in real-time prosthetic control. This work contributes the foundation for future AI integration in biomedical applications, particularly in assistive technologies. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in assistive engineering through detailed exploration of sEMG signal processing and gesture recognition.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Integrating a genetic algorithm with Pandapower power flow calculations and statistical models, the approach identifies optimal BESS locations with geographic and economic restrictions. Initial characterization of reliability indices (SAIDI, SAIFI, ENS) highlights the range with the highest probability of occurrence. Evaluation of the optimization model focuses on the search space defined by available buses for BESS placement and solution repetition. Analysis reveals that reducing the number of buses in the search space has a lower impact on success probability than reducing repetitions. These findings underscore the importance of meticulous consideration of these parameters in optimizing BESS placement, facilitating informed decision-making in power distribution infrastructure planning. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Around 15 million premature babies are born annually, requiring specialized care. Incubators are vital for maintaining their body temperature, which is crucial for their well-being. Ensuring optimal conditions in incubators, including constant temperature, oxygen control, and comfort, is essential for improving the care and survival rates of these infants. Methods: To address this, an IoT-based monitoring system was developed in a hospital setting. The system comprised hardware components such as sensors and a microcontroller, along with software components including a database and a web application. The microcontroller collected data from the sensors, which was then transmitted to a broker via WiFi using the MQTT protocol. The broker validated and stored the data in the database, while the web application provided real-time access, alerts, and event recording. Results: Two certified devices were created, employing high quality components. The system was successfully implemented and tested in both the biomedical engineering laboratory and the neonatology service of the hospital. The results of the pilot test supported the concept of IoT-based technology, demonstrating satisfactory responses in temperature, humidity, and sound variables within the incubators. Conclusions: The monitoring system facilitated efficient record traceability, allowing access to data over various timeframes. It also captured event records (alerts) related to variable problems, providing information on duration, date, hour, and minutes. Overall, the system offered valuable insights and enhanced monitoring capabilities for neonatal care. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {VichadaVichada is a departmentParticipatory design of moreCashew than 100,000 km2 in territorialColombia extension, which, due to its geographical characteristics and a context of historical violence, found difficulties in synergizing with the rest of the country. Currently, the region is known for producing outstanding quality cashewsCashew with the potential to meet national and international markets. The demand for cashewsCashew has a global growth of 7% per year, while the rate of production only reaches 6%. Various production and transformation processes have been established in the region thanks to community experimentation and iteration, which has attracted the attention of the public and private sector who see in it opportunities to boost the economic and social development of the region. The proposal of a project to take advantage of cashewCashew by-products and the development of a prototype opening machine that encourages the participation of small and medium producers in the sector is an example of this. The execution of this project was carried out under a participatory approach, to recognize existing dynamics associated with cultivation practices, production and transformation. We implemented three workshops that allowed: (1) to visualize relevant actors, (2) to identify technological and human capacities throughout the entire cashewCashew chain, and (3) to co-create models of opening machine proposals. In this chapter, we present the results of the workshops, which evidence the extensive knowledge of the territory by the local community and allow to build a more detailed picture of the factors that will later influence the dynamics of the use of the machine. At the same time, they allow to recognize both the most important actors as well as the less visible ones, thus facilitating the execution of a much more inclusive technological transfer by recognizing the need to propose solutions that contribute to the development of design and technology ledDesign against the status quo circular model, which contemplates the differences present in the daily life of the different members of the community, associated with the particularities of the territory. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a low-cost electronic system for estimating ground reaction forces (GRF) during human gait. The device consists of one master node and two slave nodes. The master node sends instructions to slave nodes that sample and store data from two force insoles located at the participant's feet. These insoles are equipped with 14 piezo-resistive FlexiForce A301 sensors (FSR). The slave nodes are attached to the ankles and feet of each participant. Subsequently, the start command is transmitted through the master node, which is connected to the USB port of a personal computer (PC). Once the walking session is completed, the information obtained by the slave nodes can be downloaded by accessing the access point generated by these devices through Wi-Fi communication. The GRF estimation system was validated with force platforms (BTS Bioengineering P6000, Italy), giving on average a fit measure equal to 68.71%±4.80% in dynamic situations. Future versions of this device are expected to increase this fit by using machine learning models. © 2024},

Polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ceramics such as nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) have been used for scaffold fabrication due to their mechanical and biological properties, which favor osteoconduction as well as mimic physical and structural characteristics of natural bone. Nanomaterials, such as carbon dots, have been implemented for this application due to their biocompatible nature and ability to improve mechanical properties and enhance biological interactions. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles embedded with carbon dots (nHA-CD) were obtained by a rapid continuous precipitation method. Carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized by the microwave-assisted method. Characterization performed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) confirmed the incorporation of CDs in nHA. A scaffold based on PEG and nHA embedded with carbon dots (PEG-nHA-CD) was synthesized using a direct mixing method. The scaffold presented a density of 0,48 g/cm3, similar to that of natural bone, indicating similar physical and structural characteristics. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized samples was evaluated by MTT and Trypan Blue assays. The results showed the potential of the PEG-nHA-CD scaffold fabricated for applications in tissue engineering aimed at future bone tissue applications. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {We present a topology optimization method based on the geometry projection technique for the design of frames made of structural shapes. An equivalent-section approach is formulated that represents the cross-section of the structural shapes as a homogeneous rectangular section. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by comparison to analyses performed using body-fitted meshes of the original sections for different loads and boundary conditions. A novel geometric representation is also introduced to represent the equivalent section as a cuboid. Like offset solids, this representation is endowed with an explicit expression for the computation of the signed distance to the boundary of the primitive and of its sensitivities, allowing for an efficient implementation. An overlap constraint is imposed via the formulation of auxiliary primitives associated to the structural members, which guarantees the resulting designs do not exhibit impractical intersections of primitives that would preclude their construction. The efficacy and efficiency of the method is demonstrated via 2D and 3D design examples. The examples demonstrate that the proposed method renders optimal designs and exhibits good convergence. They also illustrate the ability to design structures with far lower optimal volume fractions than those typically employed in continuum topology optimization techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Concerns have emerged regarding the expenses associated with integrating virtual reality into the digital transformation of companies, stemming from costs related to 3D software development and procurement of headsets. Despite the acknowledged benefits of experiential learning in military training, education and medicine, industrial adoption of virtual reality remains constrained. This study delves into the distinctive advantages of virtual reality in the elevator industry and proposes a cost-effective and innovative virtual reality (VR) training solution and evaluation model aimed at improving the learning outcomes of engineers in the field, grounded in the critical thinking theory. The proposed model seeks to capitalize on the benefits of VR in projects geared towards digital transformation by identifying "meta-requirements"and "principal designs"through a design science research method focused on problem solving. This approach has potential applications in other domains. Our methodology employs a unique strategy to develop a virtual reality experiential training program that harnesses engineers' cognitive potential to enhance their critical thinking skills. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comparative analysis with a control group trained through traditional digital methods, concentrating on "decision-making and problem-solving"as well as "thinking through hypothesis testing."Engineers undergoing virtual reality training exhibited heightened motivation, emotional engagement, and curiosity levels toward the subject, providing detailed accounts of their experiential training in relation to physical space and time. The "learning by doing"approach resulted in a 15% enhancement in critical thinking among participants, along with a notable 44% improvement in recognition memory. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Glioblastoma (GB) is a malignant brain tumour that is challenging to treat, often relapsing even after aggressive therapy. Evaluating therapy response relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. However, early assessment is hindered by phenomena such as pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS/MRSI) provides metabolomics information but is underutilised due to a lack of familiarity and standardisation. Methods: This study explores the potential of spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) in combination with several machine learning approaches, including one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), to improve therapy response assessment. Preclinical GB (GL261-bearing mice) were studied for method optimisation and validation. Results: The proposed 1D-CNN models successfully identify different regions of tumours sampled by MRSI, i.e., normal brain (N), control/unresponsive tumour (T), and tumour responding to treatment (R). Class activation maps using Grad-CAM enabled the study of the key areas relevant to the models, providing model explainability. The generated colour-coded maps showing the N, T and R regions were highly accurate (according to Dice scores) when compared against ground truth and outperformed our previous method. Conclusions: The proposed methodology may provide new and better opportunities for therapy response assessment, potentially providing earlier hints of tumour relapsing stages. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The production of cashew nuts has been increasing globally, leading to a greater volume of waste materials that require proper management. Nevertheless, cashew nutshells (CNS), currently considered waste by most processors, offer a noteworthy opportunity for alternative applications owing to their distinct physical, chemical, and thermal properties. This article reviews alternative applications for CNS that can leverage these properties, while evaluating research gaps. The potential uses are classified into three categories: material development, energy production, and substance absorption. In the materials segment, various examples are discussed where CNS serves as raw material to synthesize biopolymers, cementitious materials, and a broad range of composites. The energy production section discusses various processes that utilize CNS, including pyrolysis, gasification, and briquette production. The absorption section presents CNS and activated carbon derived from CNS as effective absorbents for liquid-phase and gas-phase applications. While this review highlights numerous research-level possibilities for CNS utilization, only a few of these options have been implemented within the industry. Consequently, further research is essential, particularly in CNS characterization, economic and environmental assessment, and real-life implementation, to broaden and enhance the integration of this biomass into applications that can contribute to the value of both its production and processing chain. © 2024, North Carolina State University.

	abstract = {Finding a balance between conflicting interests in multipurpose reservoirs is an important challenge for decision makers. This study assesses the use of different computational tools to obtain optimal reservoir operations at the Hatillo dam in the Dominican Republic. A multi-objective optimization approach is applied to models that simulate reservoir operations and three different machine learning (ML) models are employed to learn the real operation of the system. A general model is proposed to simulate daily reservoir operations (2009-2019), integrating water balances, physical constraints of the dam components, and the ML models, the latter defining daily controlled discharges. In the optimization process, the ML parameters are the decision variables, while the objectives evaluated are irrigation, hydropower generation, and flood control. The results are compared with the actual operation of the reservoir. The flood control objective was found to have a wide room for improvement over the real operation of the reservoir, and several of the solutions were found to improve the real operation for the three proposed objectives. The multilayer perceptron models tended to generate the best results for this case study and the nondominated sorting generic algorithm (NSGA II) optimizer generated the best optimization results. © 2024 American Geophysical Union.

Increasing demands, such as those imposed by climate change, require the design of mixtures that provide enhanced functional properties, while keeping the same durability of conventional porous asphalt mixtures. This study proposes different experimental PA mixes with higher air voids content and suitable structural capability than a conventional PA mixture. The functionality of the mixtures was evaluated in accordance with total and interconnected air voids, while the mechanical performance was assessed in terms of raveling resistance both in dry and wet conditions, tensile strength, and moisture sensitivity. The binder drain down was also verified. In a first stage, the experimental results were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics tests. As multiple responses were obtained, principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) were applied to explore the association pattern among the test results and experimental designs. The study concluded that PA mixes with air voids content of up to approximately 28% and admissible values of resistance can be designed. The use of polymer modified binder (PMB) and the inclusion of fibers and hydrated lime (HL) was essential for the formulation of the mixes. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper proposes novel compliant mechanisms for constructing hand prostheses based on soft robotics. Two models of prosthetic hands are developed in this work. Three mechanical evaluations are performed to determine the suitability of the two designs for carrying out activities of daily living (ADLs). The first test measures the grip force that the prosthesis can generate on objects. The second determines the energy required and dissipated from the prosthesis to operate. The third test identifies the maximum traction force that the prosthesis can support. The tests showed that the PrHand1 prosthesis has a maximum grip force of 23.38 ± 1.5 N, the required energy is 0.76 ± 0.13 J, and the dissipated energy is 0.21 ± 0.17 J. It supports a traction force of 173.31 ± 5.7 N. The PrHand2 prosthesis has a maximum grip force of 36.13 ± 2.3 N, the required energy is 1.28 ± 0.13 J, the dissipated energy is 0.96 ± 0.12 J, and it supports a traction force of 78.48 ± 0 N. In conclusion, the PrHand1 prosthesis has a better performance in terms of energy and tensile force supported. The difference between the energy and traction force results is related to two design features of the PrHand2: fully silicone-coated fingers and a unifying mechanism that requires more force on the tendons to close the prosthesis. The grip force of the PrHand2 prosthesis was more robust than the PrHand1 due to its silicone coating, which allowed for an improved grip.

	abstract = {Anthropic slopes are common in constructing embankments and earth dams and forming open pit mines and fills, among others. However, these slopes artificially built sometimes could fail due to the variability of the soils, lack of expertise in determining the design parameters, and lack of knowledge of the soil’s true behavior and construction methods, among others. To address these problems, physical models were made in a geotechnical centrifuge with similar characteristics to study the effect of variability. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using finite element models (FEM) with random geotechnical parameters for an elastic model with Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria. From these simulations, the influence of geotechnical parameters on the factor of safety and deformations was observed. The results show that the coefficient of variation obtained for the factor of safety was less than the coefficient of variation of the geotechnical parameters taken into account. This means that the coefficient of variation of the factor of safety is not the sum or the average of the coefficients of variation taken in the analysis. However, when the factor of safety is more or less constant, but the coefficient of variation of the parameters increases, the probability of failure may increase. This shows that a slope with a factor of safety greater than one can have a high probability of failure. In addition, low friction angle and low cohesion values tend to present more significant slope crest displacements. © 2023, Associacao Brasileira de Mecanica dos Solos. All rights reserved.},

In the context of the pandemic, these robots have been used to encourage the use of face masks and other biosafety measures. However, human perception in these scenarios is yet to be assessed. This study evaluates the effectiveness of using a social robot, specifically the NAO robot, to promote face-mask usage in public spaces with a hybrid experiment. The methodology involves an in-person study, as well as an online survey. The results show that the robot was able to detect correct face-mask usage with 95% accuracy, and 87.5% of participants had a positive experience interacting with the robot. Statistical results also suggest that the users perceiving a human-robot interaction scenario through a pre-recorded video can perceive differently the robot's trust, safety, and intelligence, among others. These findings suggest that social robots can be a valuable tool for promoting health and safety measures, not only during the pandemic but in other collaborative environments as well. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

The Brewster pseudo-angle concept is considered in the simulation to force the reflection component to a minimum value. The methodology focuses on the characterization and modeling of the transmission media and the plastic mine, in addition, the presence of the standing wave in the system is simulated to evaluate the return signal in the receiving antenna of the GPR. As a result, the multiband characteristic of the log-periodic fractal antenna and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10,17 dB obtained for the resonance frequency of 1,35 GHz stand out. Likewise, the pseudo-Brewster angle of 70,47° minimizes the reflection of the incident electromagnetic wave in the transition between two dielectric media, with losses and dispersive in frequency (free space-ground). © 2024, Escuela Politecnica Nacional.

	abstract = {The city of Bogota is characterized by the different problems it has related to traffic, especially with the traffic jams that occur within the capital. For this reason, people have opted for the use of alternative means of transportation such as bicycles, however, the number of accidents involving these road actors has increased over time. For this reason, we proposed the use of a learning algorithm, which is able to identify certain movements made by the cyclist with his head and depending on these, the directional signals of the bicycle will be activated, in order to provide information to the other entities of the actions performed by the cyclist. Classifiers refer to the process of training on a labeled data set (dataframe) to assign data points to classes for classification. In order to achieve this, classification models require a large amount of data to be able to predict more accurately. For this reason, the first thing that was done was the creation of the dataset, which was created from the data collection by means of the IMU of the microcontroller of the movements to be classified. After that, the windows of each movement were created, which for this project were 12 samples. The variance was calculated for each window and this was used to test the different classical classifiers (k-near neighbors, logistic regresión, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes, support vector machines and support vector machines). The best model were select using the accuracy meusurement and was easier to implement to predict the movement, which would be the logistic regression classifier. From this, the equation of this algorithm was implemented in the Arduino BLE sense 33 and this microcontroller would be placed in the cyclist's helmet to identify the movements.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The study considered El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events as a climate-forcing driver and evaporation from the reservoir network as a human-induced driver. Streamflow data was linked to previously categorized ENSO events, then standardized and classified based on date and year to evaluate inter- and intra-annual changes in streamflow. Daily evaporation losses were calculated using meteorological records and the aerodynamic method. The study also grouped 10-year periods of evaporation and streamflow to assess their ranges, rates, and water volumes. The results showed a decrease in means, volume, and maximum streamflow, while evaporation and minimum streamflow increased, especially during positive ENSOs. These changes in streamflow could have a significant impact on river-dominated dependent ecosystems, such as the MR downstream wetland complex, putting these ecosystems at risk. © 2024 IAHS.},

	abstract = {Robotics is a technology that is used in various fields; one of these in agriculture, where the robots are known as agrobots. Bearing in mind that in countries like Colombia, the cultivated lands are irregular, most of the time in mountains, and the furrows (which follow paths with very irregular shapes), it is very difficult to use automated machinery to support the cultivation work. Therefore, it is very difficult to use ground or aerial robots to support tasks such as planting, eliminating weeds, detecting diseases, the lack of fertilizers or the presence of water stress. In developed countries, where crops are grown using straight furrows and flat terrain, it is easy to have assistant robots for agricultural work, but in Colombia, where geography imposes irregular terrain, it is not easy and therefore growers cannot have technologies that support their daily work. In order to address this problem, and facilitate the use of agrobots in different crops, mainly potatoes and vegetables, research has been carried out at the Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito to propose solutions that give robots autonomy on the ground and air for exploration of crops. One of these works is related to the real-time processing of images, captured by an RGB camera placed on the front of a rover, and processed with deep learning techniques, to establish the correctness of the route that a robot must follow when running furrows in potato crops. Initially, a previous image processing is done to deliver a binary image with the shape of the furrows to a neural network. Said network analyzes the image and determines the correction angle that the robot's direction must take. For this training, a dataset of 1,000 images per class was created, taken from simulated furrows with artificial plants. The classes used correspond to a discrete scale at intervals of 10 degrees. The results show a degree of accuracy greater than 90% in the automatic detection of the angle that the robot must correct to continue moving over the furrows. In this project, different deep learning and image processing methods were analyzed and tested to give the robot autonomous movement over the furrows. © 2023 IEEE.},

Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using machine learning algorithms and intricate feature engineering, including both, time and frequency domains. The algorithms evaluated were KNN (n-nearest neighbors), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Gaussian, and SVM (Support Vector Machines). In addition to evaluating the performance of these methods, a dimensionality reduction (PCA) was carried out and the same techniques were evaluated. The aim was to develop a model capable of effectively classifying the type of terrain the robot went through. The best performance of the classifiers was achieved with the Random Forest method and a mixture of frequency characteristics. Temporal characterization techniques were also evaluated but with poor results.

	abstract = {The present paper follows the first part that aimed to develop a theoretical methodology able to derive building global damage from its structural components' damages: beams and columns in the case of RC frame buildings. This second part performs a validation and sensitivity study. It investigates the individual role of the beams and columns at the story level. It investigates afterwards the influence of the stories according to both their location along the height of the building, and their number. The theoretical predictions of the global damage are compared to reference values, which are obtained thanks to dynamic analysis performed on the OpenSees platform. Various damage distributions are tested: uniform as well as non-uniform damage for the whole components at a current story, symmetric, and non-symmetric damage distribution (at central or external columns), smooth or sharp variation from a story to its neighbors, concentration at upper or lower stories, and moderate or important damage level (low-to-medium or medium-to-high). Real ground motions are used as seismic input in order to investigate the method’s efficiency. The proposed method appears to be efficient, with acceptable accuracy, in the case of RC frame (from 4- up to 8-story height). Through the investigated cases, it can be pointed out that the adopted set of importance factor expressions (α and β factors) are relevant and suitable for seismic damage evaluation. It is worth noting that such methods can be helpful in calibrating and improving the current evaluation forms existing worldwide, for quick post-quake damage evaluation.

	abstract = {Groundwater withdrawal from aquifer exploitation leads to differential consolidation, particularly in areas where the bedrock is not uniform, such as in the case of a bedrock ridge. The resulting differential settlements during pumping induce earth fissures due to tensile stresses at the soil surface. This study specifically investigates how the height of a bedrock ridge influences the formation of earth fissures, which arise from increased effective stresses caused by differential soil consolidation. To achieve this objective, physical models were developed using a geotechnical centrifuge. The experimental results were then compared with numerical methods using the finite element method (FEM). The results obtained from the physical models provide a new understanding into the study of fissure formation process caused by a bedrock ridge, specifically in terms of fissure propagation, displacement vector magnitudes, and differential settlements. The numerical modeling, in turn, validated the experimental results by identifying zones where tensile and compressive stresses occur, based on the height of bedrock ridge. The findings indicate that earth fissures originate at the soil surface due to the concentration of tensile strains and propagate downward. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {In banking organizations, there has been a growing recognition of the need to understand how to manage knowledge effectively. However, at times, the correct path to address this need is not clear. According to studies and analyses based on more than 15 knowledge management frameworks, such as the European Committee for Standardization (2004) Knowledge Management Framework (CWA 14924-1) European Guide to Good Practice in Knowledge Management, it has been proposed that the most commonly used methods and tools for this purpose are those that facilitate knowledge exchange, such as learning platforms and process documentation [11]. However, in some cases, these tools are not sufficient to fully internalize knowledge within the organization. This issue is particularly prominent in business intelligence projects within banking entities, where deficiencies in knowledge management have been observed. What is proposed is a methodology that allows for the assessment of the organization's maturity level to identify how to address this issue. The aim is to provide guidance on decision-making and to define a knowledge governance framework in which policies and procedures are established for classifying knowledge according to the organization's needs. © 2023 IMCIC.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound recently studied as a potential therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. However, this molecule possesses low solubility in water which complicates its direct use in the organism, making it essential to find a drug delivery system to carry this molecule through hydrophilic environments. To achieve this, carbon dots (CDs) with a polar surface were synthesized from citric acid and urea by solvothermal method, followed by the surface functionalization of the CDs via the adsorption of curcumin molecules (CD-Cur). This nanoplatform was encapsulated inside an electro-responsive hydrogel based on dextran and aniline (Dex/HDI/AT), which acts as a vehicle for CD-Cur. To evaluate the improvement of solubility of curcumin, a drug encapsulation test was carried out to compare its encapsulation rate to a molecule of great hydrophilicity, fluorescein. The results of FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy and zeta potential tests enabled to identify the composition of CDs and the functionalization of CD-Cur. The composition and structure of Dex/HDI/AT was confirmed by FTIR and SEM. Finally, the drug encapsulation test demonstrated the capacity of CDs to improve the interaction of hydrophobic curcumin molecules with aqueous-based environments such as the one offered by the DEX/HDI/AT hydrogel. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In this work, a unique database of 6726 multispectral images of coffee leaves is presented. These images were captured in JPG format for the RGB photos and in TIF format for the five multispectral bands: blue, green, red, NIR and red edge, providing a detailed view of different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Images in TIF format have a color depth of 16 bits per pixel, ensuring good quality. The blue band (Band 1) captures light in the blue region of the spectrum, approximately 450 to 500 nm. The green band (Band 2) records light in the green region, approximately between 500 and 620 nm. The red band (Band 3) captures light in the red region, between 620 and 750 nm. The red-edge band (Band 4) lies between the red band and the NIR, and is sensitive to the transition between green vegetation and non-vegetation, around 840 nm. Finally, the near infrared band (Band 5) captures light in the near infrared region, between 750 and 900 nm. For ease of identification, images are labeled as follows: if the image name ends in 0, it is an RGB image; if it ends in 1, it corresponds to the blue band; if it ends in 2, to the green band; if it ends in 3, to the red band; if it ends in 4, to the red-edge band; and if it ends in 5, to the near-infrared band. The images show coffee leaves with and without lesions caused by the Hemileia vastatrix fungus, known as coffee rust. These samples were collected from Colombian coffee farms and the images were captured under controlled lighting conditions to ensure quality and consistency. This database is an invaluable resource for precision agriculture research and early detection of crop diseases. With these 6726 images, researchers can use advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to identify differences between healthy leaves and those affected by rust. This can lead to the development of effective predictive models, enabling early detection and more efficient management of diseases in coffee plantations, optimizing production and reducing economic losses for farmers. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The recovery of degraded marine coasts and the improvement of natural habitats are current issues of vital importance for the development of life, both marine and terrestrial. In this sense, the immersion of artificial reefs (ARs) in the marine environment is a way to stimulate the recovery of these damaged ecosystems. But it is necessary to have a multidisciplinary approach that analyses the materials, designs and construction process of artificial reefs in order to understand their true impact on the environment. For this reason, this paper presents the manufacture of artificial reefs by 3D printing, proposing designs with a combination of prismatic and random shapes, with different external overhangs as well as inner holes. For the definition of the artificial reef designs, criteria provided by marine biologists and the results obtained from a numerical simulation with ANSYS were taken into account, with which the stability of the artificial reefs on the seabed was analysed. Three dosages of cement mortars and three dosages of geopolymer mortars were studied as impression materials. The studies included determination of the rheological properties of the mortars, to define the printability, determination of the cost of the materials used, and determination of the mechanical strength and biological receptivity in prismatic specimens that were immersed in the sea for 3 months. To evaluate the environmental impact of the materials used in the production of the mortars, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out. In order to choose the mortars that encompassed the best properties studied, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) was applied and the two best mortars were used for the manufacture of the artificial reefs. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the 3D printing process used were analysed. The results of the studies carried out in this research show that cement mortars have better characteristics for artificial reef applications using 3D printing, and that the technique applied for the manufacture of the artificial reefs allowed the digital models to be faithfully reproduced. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The artificial samples of power demand are generated employing a uniform probability distribution with a range between the recorded maximum and the estimated minimum demand. The method was validated with a study case based on the data from a feeder with 2304 clients provided by a network operator in Colombia, the data did not present a fixed sample frequency. The proposed method was applied to generate load profile estimations for the IEEE 13-bus test feeder at each load point.

	abstract = {Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) causes permanent disabilities, such as foot drop. This condition affects the gait pattern, increasing the metabolic cost and risk of falling. Robotics with serious games has shown promising results in the gait rehabilitation context. This paper aims to analyze the effects of using the T-FLEX exoskeleton with (1) Automated Therapy (AT) and (2) Serious Game Therapy (SGT) in two ABI patients. Each participant completed six assisted sessions for each strategy. Results showed that AT increases the user-robot interaction torque by 10% for the first patient and 70% for the second patient, and SGT decreases by 5% for both patients. This way, SGT required the patient to generate torque to execute the ankle movement, while AT did the opposite, resulting in greater device assistance. In the functional assessment, SGT induced variations greater than 50% for the paretic ankle and knee's range of motion (ROM), indicating a potential for motor recovery. Thus, SGT led to improved ankle control and increased gait speed compared to AT. These findings suggest that SGT may be an effective rehabilitation strategy for ABI-related foot drop patients. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: The management of Interface Control Documents (ICDs) has shown to be a major pain point in the architecting processes of Systems of Systems (SoS). Objective: This work aims to improve on previously identified ICD management issues using the documentation-as-code philosophy as a potential basis for a treatment, and in collaboration with practitioners. Method: We conducted a Technical Action Research (TAR) study with a group of engineers at the Netherlands Radio Astronomy Institute (ASTRON), in the context of the LOFAR radio telescope. An additional research instrument, in the form of an expert panel, was used to evaluate the transferability of the proposed treatment to alternative domains. Results: In-depth insights on previously identified interface management issues were gained. Based on these insights a functional proof-of-concept was developed aimed at addressing these issues following the documentation-as-code principles. In addition to receiving overall positive reviews from practitioners and experts, further areas of improvement and transferability considerations for future work were identified. Conclusions: The proposed approach, which to our knowledge has not been explored before in this context, is promising to address some of the recurring interfacing-related issues with directed SoS in multiple engineering domains. This could be done mainly by enforcing consistency and completeness on both text-based and formal elements of the ICDs, and turning ICDs into single sources of truth for the architecting processes of large scale SoS. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The EEG technique was analyzed for five different music styles, such as classical, rock, jazz, vallenato, and urban, and in this way, to determine the influence in brainwave patterns. For instance, classical music was linked to alpha brainwave patterns associated with relaxation, while genres like rock and reggaeton are associated with beta patterns, indicating of concentration and mental activity. The study also explores how intrinsic factors such as musical lyrics and individual differences like musical training and preferences impact brain activity. Findings suggest that music can evoke strong emotional responses and activate different brain regions depending on the genre and individual factors. This complexity underscores the importance of considering personal and cultural aspects in understanding the neural dynamics of musical experiences.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the geotechnical area, advances in diatomaceous soil research are laconic and mainly oriented towards understanding the primary soil response (typical characterization methods) considering observation and experience (failures in construction processes or unexpected laboratory results) more than following a scientific method. Coincident results have been evidenced in the correspondence between the content of frustules, the effective friction angle and the water retention capacity. However, the variables and processes that control some mechanical behaviors have yet to be documented in the literature, such as the level of fracturing of the frustules and its relation with interlocked behavior, compressibility and shear strength. In addition to the bibliographic background, SEM microscopy records are presented. These facilitate the understanding of the described phenomena. The images highlight the level of deterioration, the environment, the morphology and the pores present in diatoms of different origins. The morphology (as a function of the species) of intact or fractured frustules (depending on the stress record) affects the mechanical responses and volumetric variations of the diatomaceous deposits. Furthermore, this review presents some emerging research lines in diatomaceous soils, such as the subjection of structures to geotechnical centrifuge conditions, some constitutive models and the criteria for developing water retention curves. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The material extrusion 3d printing technique has proved to be reliable and low cost for obtaining metal parts. Therefore, in the present work, its suitability for obtaining pieces of a material composed of iron/iron oxide from an industrial waste was studied. Once the powder was obtained by chemical partial reduction, filaments were manufactured with a polymer matrix of TPE/PP/SA in a polymer–powder proportion of 13–87 wt.%. The influence of temperature and printing speed on the geometry of the printed and sintered parts, as well as on their mechanical and microstructural properties, was evaluated. The results showed that the printing speed had a significant impact on the print geometry of the parts, while the printing temperature had no effect. During thermal debinding and sintering, an additional chemical reduction due to the production of reducing agents during the decomposition of the polymer matrix was observed. This shows that the selection of the polymer matrix affects the microstructure of the sintered parts. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The integration of these devices enables gait rehabilitation and functional compensation, promoting natural over-ground walking. This article presents the Adaptable Robotic Platform for Gait Rehabilitation and Assistance (AGoRA V2 platform), which integrates the new AGoRA V2 Smart Walker and the AGoRA V2 unilateral lower-limb exoskeleton. It was evaluated with 14 healthy subjects using physiological and kinematic variables and a perception assessment. The study entailed four conditions: Without exoskeleton (WOE), With Exoskeleton (WE&T), With Walker (WW), and With Platform (WP). Results indicate a reduction in the muscle activity of the Rectus Femoris (18%) and Vastus Lateralis (15%), comparing WE&T and WP, as well as walking without any device (WOE) and using any robotic device (WE&T, WW, WP). Results suggest the importance of combining the exoskeleton with the robotic walker and the assistance of each device independently. Moreover, using the complete platform induces slower gait patterns than the walker, as the mean impulse force and linear velocity decrease by 42% and 44%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the platform contributes to safety, and improvements in gait parameters and muscular activity, indicating the system's potential to act as a modular device according to users' conditions and therapeutic goals. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this research is to analyze the perception of service in public sector companies in the city of Bogota via Twitter and text mining to identify areas, problems, and topics aiming for quality service improvement. To achieve this objective, a structured method for data modeling is implemented based on the KDD methodology. Tweets from January to June 2022 related to the companies in the sector are processed, and a temporal analysis of the evolution of sentiment is performed based on the dictionaries Bing, AFINN, and NRC. Subsequently, the LDA algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm) is used to visually identify the topics with the greatest negative impact reported by the users in each of the 6 months by adding the temporal dimension. The results revealed that, for Aqueduct (water supply service), the topic with the highest dissatisfaction is related to the “Water Tank Request” processes; for Enel (energy services) “Service Outages”; and for Vanti (gas services), “Case solution and request information”. Temporal patterns of tweets, sentiments, and topics are also highlighted for the three companies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer simulations, and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly becoming accessible tools that can be leveraged to implement training protocols and educational resources. Typical assessment tools related to sensory and neural processing associated with task performance in virtual environments often rely on self-reported surveys, unlike electroencephalography (EEG), which is often used to compare the effects of different types of sensory feedback (e.g., auditory, visual, and haptic) in simulation environments in an objective manner. However, it can be challenging to know which aspects of the EEG signal represent the impact of different types of sensory feedback on neural processing. Machine learning approaches offer a promising direction for identifying EEG signal features that differentiate the impact of different types of sensory feedback during simulation training. For the current study, machine learning techniques were applied to differentiate neural circuitry associated with haptic and non-haptic feedback in a simulated drilling task. Nine EEG channels were selected and analyzed, extracting different time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features, where 360 features were tested (40 features per channel). A feature selection stage identified the most relevant features, including the Hurst exponent of 13–21 Hz, kurtosis of 21–30 Hz, power spectral density of 21–30 Hz, variance of 21–30 Hz, and spectral entropy of 13–21 Hz. Using those five features, trials with haptic feedback were correctly identified from those without haptic feedback with an accuracy exceeding 90%, increasing to 99% when using 10 features. These results show promise for the future application of machine learning approaches to predict the impact of haptic feedback on neural processing during VR protocols involving drilling tasks, which can inform future applications of VR and simulation for occupational skill acquisition. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive approach to the optimization of financial portfolios is provided by the Integral Analysis Method (IAM), which comprises four steps: The description of the problem is followed by three mathematical steps, namely, cardinal analysis, ordinal analysis and integration analysis, which allow simultaneously involving ordinal and cardinal variables in an optimization problem. The cardinal analysis uses the L_1 risk model, which is enriched by the inclusion of a stochastic constraint on the successful performance forecast attributed to each of the shares that make up the investment portfolio. This bound, however, does not alter the linear nature of the model. The Ordinal analysis includes expert opinions on the reputation of each company as a qualitative criterion. This completes two of the most relevant aspects of the investment portfolio optimization problem: success probability (assessed through the cardinal analysis) and business reputation (assessed through the ordinal analysis). By resorting to Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis, the integration analysis allows obtaining indicators that jointly evaluate the variables resulting from the two previous analyses. As a validation process, IAM was applied to simulated data. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Every year about 45,000 Colombians experience a stroke. Stroke, along with other cerebrovascular diseases, is the country’s second leading cause of death and the main cause of disability. This is attributed to multiple factors such as lifestyles, ethnic factors, access to healthcare, and lack of resources. It is estimated that about 38% of citizens do not recognize the symptoms of a stroke, and only 40% of cases go to an emergency hotline for prompt attention. Due to this high disease burden, about 2.6% of the population have disabilities, for whom few health policies provide quality access to rehabilitation therapies at the rural and urban levels. The conjunction of sociopolitical and economic conditions for the distribution of resources is insufficient to provide effective treatments within the health system. Functional rehabilitation services in specialized centers are the standard care for people with disabilities. Few rehabilitation centers have robotic therapies that provide intensive, repetitive, and task-specific treatment. However, access to those services is less than 1% for patients with motor problems. Through multidisciplinary research of engineers and clinicians, Colombians have sought to develop strategies and technological solutions for treating patients poststroke. Some of the developments involve lower-limb and upper-limb exoskeletons and active orthoses. Furthermore, other studies have focused on technologies such as Lokomat, social robotics, and the inclusion of neurofeedback techniques such as brain-computer interface, virtual reality, and serious games. Each of these strategies has been evolving to support rehabilitation processes. In the future, these technological developments are expected to make rehabilitation more accessible to reduce the disease’s prevalence in the country gradually. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Within the framework of the energy transition, electrical distribution grid operators require effective tools to predict the demand of individual users. These tools are necessary for an adequate planning of future generation resources and infrastructure modernization. However, understanding future electricity needs poses a significant challenge, especially in emerging economies, where historical data are manually collected on a monthly or bi-monthly basis and exhibit a significant amount of missing information. In response to the above, this work proposes a novel heuristics-based method for medium-term energy demand forecasting with scarce data. Qualitative and quantitative information was abstracted into a mathematical model representing the trend and noise components of historical energy consumption observations. In addition, external factors were considered as an additional layer for the mathematical model, in order to account for events that could not be foreseen by merely using the dataset. A train-test data split was proposed to iteratively search for the best parameters to predict electricity demand with respect to different categorical divisions of users (social stratum, rural or urban location, and municipality). For testing and validation, real historical data were used, as provided by the regional distribution system operator (DSO) of the department of Huila, Colomba. The results suggest a trade-off between accuracy and computational intensity, as well as the fact that a non-categorical approach leads to the algorithm with the best performance (average absolute error of 1.61%) at a low computational cost. © 2024, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

More precisely, let G be a topological group, and A a unital symmetric C∗-subalgebra of UC(G), the algebra of bounded uniformly continuous functions on G. Generalizing the notion of a stable metric, we study A-metrics δ, i.e., the function δ(e, ·) belongs to A; the case A = WAP(G), the algebra of weakly almost periodic functions on G, recovers stability. If the topology of G is induced by a left invariant metric d, we prove that A determines the topology of G if and only if d is uniformly equivalent to a left invariant A-metric. As an application, we show that the additive group of C[0, 1] is not reflexively representable; this is a new proof of Megrelishvili [Topological transformation groups: selected topics, Elsevier, 2007, Question 6.7] (the problem was already solved by Ferri and Galindo [Studia Math. 193 (2009), pp. 99–108] with different methods and later the results were generalized by Yaacov, Berenstein, and Ferri [Math. Z. 267 (2011), pp.129–138]). Let now G be a metric group, and assume A ⊆ LUC(G), the algebra of bounded left uniformly continuous functions on G, is a unital C∗algebra which is the uniform closure of coefficients of representations of G on members of F, where F is a class of Banach spaces closed under l2-direct sums. We prove that A determines the topology of G if and only if G embeds into the isometry group of a member of F, equipped with the weak operator topology. As applications, we obtain characterizations of unitary and reflexive representability. © 2024 American Mathematical Society.},

	abstract = {Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) has emerged as a suitable material for pavement rehabilitation, particularly in the context of bridge engineering. This material’ attributes and performance-related characteristics have attracted attention due to the numerous advantages and potential for enhanced long-term durability of deteriorated pavements, either cementitious or asphaltic. Because of its relevance and increased use in recent years for pavement engineering applications, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent case studies that investigate the application of UHPC in bridge pavement rehabilitation or reconstruction projects. The selected case studies include projects conducted in America, Asia, and Europe, and provide valuable insights into the design, construction, and performance of UHPC overlays. These showcase the effectiveness of UHPC in addressing common issues such as cracking, rutting, and structural deficiencies in bridge pavements. Furthermore, these highlight the superior flexural and compressive strength of UHPC, which contributes to improved load-carrying capacity and resistance to permanent deformation. Moreover, some environmental benefits derived from UHPC such as smaller carbon footprint are highlighted in the paper as well as cost-effectiveness considerations in light of the long-term performance and reduced maintenance obtained with UHPC overlays. Overall, the comprehensive literature review and case studies presented in this paper provide valuable data on material properties, project types, construction techniques, and post-rehabilitation evaluations. These findings can guide future research and assist practitioners in making informed decisions regarding the implementation of UHPC overlays for pavement rehabilitation. Finally, this paper contributes to the existing body of knowledge on UHPC overlays and emphasizes their significance in improving the longevity and sustainability of bridge pavements. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In cities in developing countries, several tons of unprocessed aluminum are buried every day. This is because some kinds of aluminum by-products exhibit low recyclability through remelting, as is the case with sawn mechanical chips. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to address the problem of aluminum chip recycling. The technical approach included the development of a reinforced aluminum with mill scale, an iron oxide by-product from the high-temperature rolling of steel. Aluminum chips and mill scale were ground separately and the resulting powders were characterized. Next, the powders were mixed at different percentages of mill scale (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%), compacted, and sintered in a protective atmosphere. Iron oxide–aluminum composites were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, hardness tests, and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The iron oxide particles and aluminum matrix produced a thermite reaction, forming different kinds of interfaces as a function of the quantity of the mill scale. It was found that 0.5% mill scale is the optimal value for addition, because it improves the hardness of the composite from 50.0 ± 2.4 HRF to 99.9 ± 2.5 HRF. The corrosion rate decreased from 496.7 μm/year to 21.0 μm/year. © 2023, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.},

	abstract = {(CrAlTiV)N coatings were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on AISI H13 steel substrates at various Ti–V contents. The microstructural evolution, chemical composition and phases of coatings, were studied systematically by scanning, atomic force and transmission microscopies, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The corrosion response of the coatings was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. Crystalline structures of CrAlN and CrAlTiVN were developed. The morphology of pyramidal tips disappeared, increasing the densification of the coatings and decreasing their roughness and the grain size as their amount of Ti/V increased. An evident protection of AISI H13 steel against corrosion was presented in all coating systems, which were characterized by their dielectric behavior. The high densification, smaller grain size and the formation of the nitride phase (CrAlTiV)N contributed to this having the best corrosion performance, while the appearance of the amorphous phase VN with superconductive character of the (CrAlTiV)N-14 at% coating led to an increase in its conductivity despite its apparently compact structure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Meanwhile, artificial intelligence now has advanced capacity for natural language processing (NLP) through tools such as sentiment analysis and topic identification. This research uses machine learning algorithms to prove the hypothesis that it is possible to find correlations between news information and water resource problems. The 207 water bodies in the Magdalena River Basin, Colombia, were analyzed alongside 19,490 news articles published between 2016 and 2020 in 42 online newspapers. A platform for the visualization of spatiotemporal information was developed as a proof of concept. There has been a noticeable increase in digital news about the Magdalena River Basin in recent years and some correlation with extreme events, but the comparison between the sentiments and measured physical variables was inconclusive. This is likely due to the difficulty in filtering the topic from obtained news, as well as in precisely identifying the spatial location and temporal range of events. In the future, NLP techniques to analyze news articles could be used to provide additional information for decision making at the basin level. © 2024 American Geophysical Union.

	abstract = {Lack of motivation and low adherence rates are critical concerns of long-term rehabilitation programmes, such as cardiac rehabilitation. Socially assistive robots are known to be effective in improving motivation in therapy. However, over longer durations, generic and repetitive behaviours by the robot often result in a decrease in motivation and engagement, which can be overcome by personalising the interaction, such as recognising users, addressing them with their name, and providing feedback on their progress and adherence. We carried out a real-world clinical study, lasting 2.5 years with 43 patients to evaluate the effects of using a robot and personalisation in cardiac rehabilitation. Due to dropouts and other factors, 26 patients completed the programme. The results derived from these patients suggest that robots facilitate motivation and adherence, enable prompt detection of critical conditions by clinicians, and improve the cardiovascular functioning of the patients. Personalisation is further beneficial when providing high-intensity training, eliciting and maintaining engagement (as measured through gaze and social interactions) and motivation throughout the programme. However, relying on full autonomy for personalisation in a real-world environment resulted in sensor and user recognition failures, which caused negative user perceptions and lowered the perceived utility of the robot. Nonetheless, personalisation was positively perceived, suggesting that potential drawbacks need to be weighed against various benefits of the personalised interaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Context. The new generation of galaxy surveys will provide unprecedented data that will allow us to test gravity deviations at cosmological scales at a much higher precision than could be achieved previously. A robust cosmological analysis of the large-scale structure demands exploiting the nonlinear information encoded in the cosmic web. Machine-learning techniques provide these tools, but no a priori assessment of the uncertainties. Aims. We extract cosmological parameters from modified gravity (MG) simulations through deep neural networks that include uncertainty estimations. Methods. We implemented Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with an enriched approximate posterior distribution considering two cases: the first case with a single Bayesian last layer (BLL), and the other case with Bayesian layers at all levels (FullB). We trained both BNNs with real-space density fields and power spectra from a suite of 2000 dark matter-only particle-mesh N-body simulations including MG models relying on MG-PICOLA, covering 256 h−1 Mpc side cubical volumes with 1283 particles. Results. BNNs excel in accurately predicting parameters for Ωm and σ8 and their respective correlation with the MG parameter. Furthermore, we find that BNNs yield well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that overcome the over- and under-estimation issues in traditional neural networks. The MG parameter leads to a significant degeneracy, and σ8 might be one possible explanation of the poor MG predictions. Ignoring MG, we obtain a deviation of the relative errors in Ωm and σ8 by 30% at least. Moreover, we report consistent results from the density field and power spectrum analysis and comparable results between BLL and FullB experiments. This halved the computing time. This work contributes to preparing the path for extracting cosmological parameters from complete small cosmic volumes towards the highly nonlinear regime. © The Authors 2024.},

	abstract = {The evolution of land use occupancy in various cities worldwide is swift. Land-use planning processes are still recent in most Latin American countries with significant socio-spatial inequalities. Due to rapid urban growth and real estate pressure, peri-urban areas of metropolises become susceptible to economic interests that can disrupt land use and municipal planning. Therefore, considering spatial justice, it is crucial to analyse possible future urban scenarios regarding socio-economic activities and their spatial distributions. This research seeks to define optimal locations and suitable urban growth areas, ensuring socio-spatial equity and justice. The study area is the municipality of Chia, on the outskirts of the metropolis of Bogota, Colombia, where the research proposes an analysis of urban morphology and the (social) intensity of activities and infrastructure. As a methodology, space syntax and the distribution of residential and non-residential activity data are applied through a predictive model. The study concludes that future mitigation of urban inequalities based on land use will be difficult to achieve owing to the location of urban sprawl areas. © 2024},

So far, we have proposed a data strategy model that was validated with the private sector, and we are working on the first version of the model adaptation for the design of an effective data strategy for smart territories. We presented this advance in the paper Designing a Data Strategy for Organizations and its adaptation of Smart Territories [8]. We will expand and customize the model focusing on the field of competitiveness of Smart Territories. One of the biggest challenges in the research is identifying the boundaries of competitiveness and, subsequently, how to use the data effectively to expand them.

	abstract = {Joint Attention (JA) is a fundamental social interaction capability developed in early childhood by sharing a common focus point with others. However, this skill is commonly affected in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In this sense, social robots emerged as a tool for developing novel JA intervention strategies supporting therapists. Therefore, this work presents a study to determine the best combination of robot and therapist participation in JA therapies based on following the gaze of the mediator with verbal and pointing instructions. Sixteen subjects with ASD participated in seven robot-assisted sessions divided into a robot-assisted group (RAG) and a control group (CG), performing equivalent intervention sessions. A focus visual system measured quantitative and reliable JA metrics, while the robot's participation was progressively increased in the RAG to manage all the instructions at the last session. Results show that participants of the RAG had better JA scores than the CG during sessions 6 and 7 (=0.029 and p=0.018, respectively). The RAG paid more visual attention and presented more social engagement behaviours in the sessions (p< 0.05). Moreover, the best JA performance was given when the therapist and the robot requested similar instructions during the activities.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Are currencies undervalued or overvalued concerning the dollar? Is absolute and relative purchasing power parity (PPP) observed in Colombia? We address these issues by using a longitudinal data structure and estimating a panel data model. For the Colombian case, there were instances where official reports indicated an appreciation of the peso against the dollar, but the Big Mac index showed a real depreciation. The estimates suggest empirical evidence in favor of absolute PPP, i.e., based on the log-transformed equation estimated using the GLS method, while there is no empirical evidence in favor of meeting PPP in relative terms. © 2024 Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia.

	abstract = {This document presents the development of an edge artificial intelligence application for hand gesture recognition using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) LSM9DS1. The study aimed to differentiate between four specific hand gestures: upward movement for forward, downward movement for stop, leftward movement for turn left, and rightward movement for turn right. Such gesture recognition systems can be crucial in enhancing human-computer interaction, enabling more intuitive control mechanisms for various applications, including assistive technologies for people with disabilities and innovative user interfaces for smart devices. The IMU was integrated into an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board to capture acceleration and gyroscope values in three Cartesian axes (X, Y, Z) as a reference point. A dataset was created with 150 repetitions of each gesture, totaling 450 repetitions per gesture, involving all group members as test subjects. Data collection was facilitated using the Arduino IDE and a specialized library for the IMU, with data migration to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. The accelerometer and gyroscope signals were analyzed, characterized by the variance in a time window of 0.2 seconds without overlap. The following methods were evaluated: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes Gaussian (NBG), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The best performance was achieved by the Bayesian classifier, which was implemented in the 33BLEsense SoC. The results demonstrated the circuit's effectiveness in accurately recognizing and differentiating between the four gestures, using less than 10% of program memory and maintaining low computational consumption.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) plays an important role in global agriculture, particularly in commercializing the cashew kernel. Nevertheless, kernel extraction poses a challenge due to the nut variable shape and size. Characterizing the properties of the cashew nut becomes a pivotal input for the advancement of processes and machinery. This work presents a comprehensive characterization of raw and steamed cashew nuts from Puerto Carreño, Colombia, with focus on morphological, physical, and mechanical properties. Cashew nut samples from different farms in the region were collected. Morphological properties, including size and shape, were analyzed by measuring length, width, and thickness for 100 nuts from each supplier, both in their raw state and after steaming. Geometric diameter and sphericity were calculated, and qualitative shape characterization was performed. Physical properties, such as mass, bulk density, true density, and moisture content, were also measured. Angle of repose and coefficient of friction were determined to assess flow and frictional behavior. Additionally, compressive mechanical properties were evaluated through uniaxial compression testing along three orientations. The findings indicated significant differences in morphological and mechanical properties between raw and steamed cashew nuts. Conversely, the results demonstrated that cashew nuts from Vichada region exhibit a noteworthy degree of dispersion and larger dimensions than those from Asia and Africa, comparable to those from Brazil. The findings guide machinery design in the cashew industry and offer insights into the physical, morphological, and mechanical properties of cashew nuts in Puerto Carreño, contributing to understanding and enabling quality assessment, processing optimization, and product development. © 2024, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2024 Anderson Sanchez, Hernan Camilo Pacheco Barragán, Javier Urbano-T, Camilo Ayala-Garcia, Oscar Alberto Alvarez Solano, Alejandro Maranon, Alicia Porras and Camilo Hernandez.},

Third, its resistance to fuel spillage was studied. Fourth, a multi-criteria analysis was performed to determine the best performing mixture considering all the studied variables. Regarding the results, mixture with aramid and polyolefin was the best performing blend according to the multi-criteria analysis. The fiber content allowed for acceptable performance in terms of particle loss despite having a higher void content than the reference mixtures. In addition, a higher permeability and clogging resistance was found, so the use of such fibers did not negatively affect the internal structure of the mixture. Finally, it had a higher resistance to fuel spillage due to the use of polymer-modified bitumen. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Data are an invaluable asset for the private sector as well as for government and non-government organizations, the academy and, in general, for all communities. During the last few years, different frameworks have appeared proposing practices to obtain the greatest value from data organizationally. The use of data has been mainly understood in data governance as the central axis of the design and implementation of strategies that expect data to be really captured, transformed, and used in an accurate way within the organization. A data strategy is the instrument that allows aligning the data with strategic objectives, so data governance as the central axis without an efficient data strategy will not generate the expected results. Therefore, this article presents a model for the design of data strategy. The main contributions of the proposed model are the focus on strategic objectives, the use of best practices from previous research combined with the incorporation of data knowledge and its behavior in early stages, and the design of a work plan that encourages the appropriation and incorporation of the data strategy in an organization. In addition to presenting the model, we discuss the results of its implementation, we analyze and outline the issues identified for its adaptation in the context of a smart city, and we also explain the first version of such adaptation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) has been explored in several applications within the sustainability principles and circular economy of agro-industrial product waste. To understand the anticorrosive and lubricant properties of CNSL solutions, a multi-faceted approach, incorporating electrochemical analyses, immersion test, tribological measurements, and tribochemical characterization was carried out for mild steel AISI 1012, stainless steel AISI 420 and Aluminium Alloy 6061. Electrochemical analyses reveal a positive impact of CNSL, inducing a shift in corrosion potential to more positive values and a decrease in corrosion current, indicating effective corrosion inhibition for stainless steel and aluminium alloy. In mild steel, CNSL exhibits a mixed-type inhibition with efficiency increasing in correlation with oil concentration. The lubricating properties of CNSL are evident according to the coefficients of friction (COF) obtained and the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime observed during tribological tests. Tribochemical tests demonstrate a reduction in wear and an improvement in tribocorrosion behavior under sliding conditions. CNSL emerges as a promising tribocorrosion mitigator, demonstrating multifaceted benefits. The concentration-dependent effects highlight the need for optimization in specific applications, particularly for passive materials. CNSL not only inhibits corrosion through film formation but also provides effective lubrication, reducing friction, wear, and chemical-mechanical degradation. This research contributes valuable insights to corrosion science. It proposes practical applications for CNSL in diverse industrial contexts, showcasing its potential as an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution for tribocorrosion challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the diseases with the highest mortality rate worldwide. Recent studies have shown that different types of nanoparticles, such as carbon dots (CDs), are promising candidates in applications against cancer due to their physical-chemical properties. Moreover, CDs have a high load capacity to integrate with heteroatoms or drugs through doping and functionalization. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of undoped CDs (uCDs) and boron-doped CDs (B-CDs). They were synthesized in a one-step, microwave-assisted reaction at 200 ℃, using citric acid as the carbon source, and four different amino acids were evaluated as nitrogen precursors. Additionally, boric acid was used as the boron precursor for synthesizing B-CDs, obtaining nanoparticles that exhibit green-yellow fluorescence. MTT assay showed that both, uCDs and B-CDs are biocompatible exhibiting viability rates of over 80% after 24 h in HT29, 3T3-L1, U87, and VERO cell lines. The obtained results represent an excellent opportunity to apply these developed B-CDs as cancer theranostic nanoagents and bioimaging probes. In particular, its boron content as a dopant makes them a promising alternative for boron neutron capture therapy (BCNT). © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The objective is to determine the magnitude in which these ratios help to forecast excess returns and if there is any evidence that one of the ratios outperforms the other. Furthermore, the study addresses the impact of the spread between the domestic and the foreign policy interest rate in the excess asset returns. Using Bayesian techniques, the findings suggest that the magnitude of the effect is similar for both ratios and that the impact is slightly higher in the case of firms with higher book-to-market ratios.

	abstract = {This paper addresses topics related to emergency management and urban resilience under seismic risk. It focuses on post-seismic structural damage evaluation and urban resilience: the damage suffered by buildings influence the residual capacity for dwelling and sheltering at early post-disaster stages. This paper proposes a new theoretical method for quick evaluation of these damages: it derives the global structural damage from the observed damage on the structural components of a frame, i.e. beams and columns (vertical components, horizontal, or bracing elements). The global residual capacity of the building is derived from those of the successive stories: from the basement to the roof. Therefore, it proposes a relationship between the structural damage and the residual probability of failure. It also develops and assigns adequate importance factors for each component (beam, column), at the story level, and importance factor for each story and its location, from bottom to top. The proposed method is compared with classical mechanical approaches: the global damage values are in good accordance, for the adopted case studies. Furthermore, a pushover analysis is performed in order to investigate the influence of the columns' location at the story level: the column's influence it located at the edge, interior, or exterior location. The investigation of the effect of the column location in a story, of the story location along the building height, will contribute in developing new quick evaluation forms at the post-seismic stage and allow quick recovery at the urban scale. © 2024 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, emphasizes the creation of algorithms capable of learning from data and generating predictions. However, in actuarial science, the interpretability of these models often presents challenges, raising concerns about their accuracy and reliability. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to address these issues by facilitating the development of accurate and comprehensible models. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of various XAI approaches for tackling distinct data-driven insurance problems. The machine learning methods are evaluated based on their accuracy, employing the mean absolute error for regression problems and the accuracy metric for classification problems. Moreover, the interpretability of these methods is assessed through quantitative and qualitative measures of the explanations offered by each explainability technique. The findings reveal that the performance of different XAI methods varies depending on the particular insurance problem at hand. Our research underscores the significance of considering accuracy and interpretability when selecting a machine-learning approach for resolving data-driven insurance challenges. By developing accurate and comprehensible models, we can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of the predictions generated by these models. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) enables the development of virtual training frameworks suitable for various domains, especially when real-world conditions may be hazardous or impossible to replicate because of unique additional resources (e.g., equipment, infrastructure, people, locations). Although VR technology has significantly advanced in recent years, methods for evaluating immersion (i.e., the extent to which the user is engaged with the sensory information from the virtual environment or is invested in the intended task) continue to rely on self-reported questionnaires, which are often administered after using the virtual scenario. Having an objective method to measure immersion is particularly important when using VR for training, education, and applications that promote the development, fine-tuning, or maintenance of skills. The level of immersion may impact performance and the translation of knowledge and skills to the real-world. This is particularly important in tasks where motor skills are combined with complex decision making, such as surgical procedures. Efforts to better measure immersion have included the use of physiological measurements including heart rate and skin response, but so far they do not offer robust metrics that provide the sensitivity to discriminate different states (idle, easy, and hard), which is critical when using VR for training to determine how successful the training is in engaging the user’s senses and challenging their cognitive capabilities. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected from 14 participants who completed VR jigsaw puzzles with two different levels of task difficulty. Machine learning was able to accurately classify the EEG data collected during three different states, obtaining accuracy rates of 86% and 97% for differentiating easy versus hard difficulty states and baseline vs. VR states. Building on these results may enable the identification of robust biomarkers of immersion in VR, enabling real-time recognition of the level of immersion that can be used to design more effective and translative VR-based training. This method has the potential to adjust aspects of VR related to task difficulty to ensure that participants are immersed in VR. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Despite the advances that have been made in the design of drones, different configurations are still being built that in many cases are adjusted to many specific situations. Thus, hexacopters with six rotors, octocopters with eight rotors and quadcopters with four rotors are the three most popular types. For the construction of the equipment, the payload, the necessary stability and the desired flight duration are just some of the variables that influence the choice of configuration, this is directly related to the work to be developed by the equipment. Along with the above, it is also essential to take into account, the material used to build it, generally, this material is light but resistant, such as carbon fiber, fiberglass reinforced plastic or aluminum alloys. The assembly of the drone's motor and propeller, which functions as its propulsion system, is crucial. Depending on the total weight of the drone and the payload it will carry, the motors are chosen. The propellers themselves must be compatible with the motors and have sufficient thrust. Last but not least, the aerodynamic design of a drone is a key factor in ensuring safe and effective flight. This design takes into account aspects such as component protection, weight distribution and body shape. It should be noted that the aerodynamic design may change depending on the size of the drone and the intended use. addresses the continued diversification in drone configuration and design, despite advances in technology. The preeminence of three predominant types is underlined: hexacopters, octocopters and quadcopters, which adapt to particular contexts. In construction, variables such as payload, stability and flight duration, linked to the specific tasks of the drone, influence the choice of configuration. The choice of material, with a focus on lightness and resistance, such as carbon fiber, fiberglass reinforced plastic or aluminum alloys, emerges as an essential aspect. The selection and combination of engines and propellers, vital in the propulsion system, are made considering the total weight and load. Aerodynamic design, encompassing component safeguarding, weight distribution and body morphology, is critical to safe and efficient flight. It is important to note that the aerodynamic design varies depending on the size and intended use of the drone.

Additionally, polarization tests were done using NOx concentrations above the levels measured from engine emissions. Results and discussion: The use of biofuels in Colombia has been largely driven by ethanol production from vegetable sources. Their use brings some advantages related to reducing emissions of particles and toxic gases (mainly, aromatic groups, NOx, and CO2). However, degradation of materials can occur when they are in direct contact with biodiesel. Furthermore, solidification into waxes, which leads to plugging of nozzles, has been reported. However, it is unknown whether this influences oxygen diffusion in the solution, and in turn, affects the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. Conclusions: The corrosion resistance of the 304 stainless steel changed under immersion conditions, even though its protective layer was not affected by the NOx concentrations registered in the biofuel mixtures. © 2022, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

	abstract = {In general, there are three types of communication in walker-assisted gait applications. On the one hand, Human-Robot Interaction refers to the features and strategies of the device that allow it to communicate physically and cognitively with the user. Similarly, Robot-Environment Interaction refers to the device's operation in a given environment. It also involves the sensors that acquire information from the environment. Finally, Human-Robot-Environment Interaction comprises the device, the user, the environment, and the clinicians in a communication channel that is natural, safe, and efficient. Thus, this chapter presents the necessary fundamentals to understand the control strategies that govern these interaction types. It also provides basic design notions to propose new control strategies for robotic walkers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202. All rights reseverd.},

On the one hand, the assistance mode uses a gait phase detection to generate a desired gait cycle in the paretic limb. On the other hand, the transparency mode is presented to simulate a back-drivable device using a mass-damper system. As a result, in the assistance mode, torques in the range of (20 - 30 Nm) for the knee and hip joints were generated to complete the user’s gait cycle. Moreover, the user can execute unrestricted movements using the AGoRA exoskeleton in the transparency mode. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Socially Assistive Robotics has emerged as a potential tool for rehabilitating cognitive and developmental disorders in children with autism. Social robots found in the literature are often able to teach critical social skills, such as emotion recognition and physical interaction. Even though there are promising results in clinical studies, there is a lack of guidelines on selecting the appropriate robot and how to design and implement the child-robot interaction. Methods: This work aims to evaluate the impacts of a social robot designed with three different appearances according to the results of a participatory design (PD) process with the community. A validation study in the emotion recognition task was carried out with 21 children with autism. Results: Spectrum disorder results showed that robot-like appearances reached a higher percentage of children's attention and that participants performed better when recognizing simple emotions, such as happiness and sadness. Discussion: This study offers empirical support for continuing research on using SAR to promote social interaction with children with ASD. Further long-term research will help to identify the differences between high and low-functioning children.

	abstract = {The architecting of Systems of Systems (SoS), that is, of systems that emerge from the cooperation of multiple independent constituent systems, is a topic of increasing interest in both industry and academia. However, recent empirical studies revealed what seems to be an overlooked aspect of the architecting of SoS that is linked to major integration and operational issues: the interplay between the various disciplines involved in such an architecting process. This aspect becomes particularly relevant for the management of the interfaces between the SoS constituents, where such disciplines inevitably meet. In this paper, we present the results of the first cycle of a Technical Action Research (TAR) study conducted in cooperation between the authors and a group of practitioners involved in the long-running architecting process of a large-scale radio astronomy SoS project. This TAR is aimed at exploring potential improvements of the document-centered interface management approach currently followed in this project by adopting elements of the documentation-as-code philosophy, which is widely adopted in the domain of software systems. As a result, a working proof-of-concept of an ICD (Interface Control Document) management approach was developed by the researchers and evaluated by the practitioners. The results of the study and the corresponding lessons learned are reported in this work. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Mirror-based robotic therapy (MRT) has been a promising rehabilitation strategy favouring upper limb muscle strength and motor control in the last years. However, there are still no studies validating this technique in lower limb experimental protocols. This paper presents an innovative visual and motor feedback strategy based on serious games and MRT modalities. Thus, a preliminary system validation with a healthy participant is performed. Moreover, the strategy's potential effects were investigated in a neurologic patient's short rehabilitation program. After six sessions, the results of the method favoured active ankle plantarflexion range of motion and muscle activation. Although the patient had a positive adaptation at the end of the game, it is necessary to improve the proposed strategy to enhance the robotic experience in the long term. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) has been associated with cognitive, emotional, physical and physiological alterations, and with the presence of anxiety disorders. There is not enough research on this problem from an interdisciplinary approach despite the above. Therefore, this research compared the emotion perception and electrophysiological responses, elicited by an emotional task, in women who had experienced IPV and women who had not (WIPV). Forty-five participants (22 with and 23 without IPV experience) were presented with nine images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database and performed a self-report using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). In parallel, electrophysiological signals (ECG and EEG) were acquired, for the analysis of emotional response. In the between-group analysis, the IPV group showed lower perceived dominance and greater central asymmetry in the alpha band than the WIPV group; additionally, the IPV group exhibited a significant positive correlation between the valence of the images and the alpha band power in central areas. In the within-group analysis, the WIPV group showed greater activation in the alpha band and alpha/beta ratio in frontal areas during the emotional elicitation, as compared to baseline. Furthermore, the ECG analysis showed that, for the IPV group, there was a decrease in the power of the high-frequency (HF) band and an increase in the power of the very-low-frequency (VLF) band of heart rate variability (HRV) during the elicitation stage. It is hypothesized that the IPV group could present higher stress levels and greater physiological activity during emotional stimuli than the WIPV group.

	abstract = {Savonius vertical-axis wind turbines are becoming an outstanding alternative for small-scale power generation mainly due to their simple design, high self-starting performance at low wind speeds, omnidirectional capability, and low cost. Over the past few decades, extensive research has suggested turbine configurations that maximize their aerodynamic performance, evaluating different influencing geometric parameters. Nevertheless, few studies have considered running large-scale experimentation, simultaneously assessing different influencing parameters, and implementing mathematical optimization techniques. Consequently, there is a need to establish a set of procedures and techniques that address these gaps. The current research proposes a new design method for a Savonius wind turbine to maximize its aerodynamic performance. The proposed method defines a numerical model for a geometry with four influencing parameters, which automatically achieves solutions to the equations that govern the motion of fluids for different turbines. The model is successfully validated with experimental results available in the literature. The numerical solutions of 340 different turbines build a response surface with excellent quality metrics based on the Kriging technique. Two mathematical optimization techniques are implemented on the response surface to determine the configuration that maximizes its aerodynamic performance. This optimal configuration is characterized under different operating conditions. The results indicate that the optimal turbine has an aspect ratio of 8.38, an overlap ratio of 0.08, a twist angle of 174.05°, and two blades. The behavior shown by the optimal turbine (maximum power coefficient of 0.21 at a wind speed of 12 m/s) is remarkable since its aerodynamic performance is superior to multiple reported turbines. The instantaneous torque that it develops is always positive during its operation, which indicates a greater capacity for self-starting and continuity in its rotation. Likewise, it supplies a maximum rotor power of approximately 160 W at a wind speed of 12 m/s. These results make the optimal turbine an attractive design for electric power generation. The proposed method provides novel insights and powerful tools for researchers to explore various geometries and operating conditions that, together with the established optimization process, accomplish the turbine that maximizes its aerodynamic performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The research program included testing of full-scale masonry walls with different thicknesses, widths, and amounts and types of FRP reinforcement. The research program also included testing of full-scale masonry wall specimens to evaluate the effect of: i) different bar lap splice lengths, ii) FRP bar diameter; iii) position of the FRP; iv) masonry strength and v) masonry material. Forty-seven masonry walls, 2.19 m high, were subjected to out-of-plane loads, tested under quasi-static loading cycles. The test specimens included walls constructed using concrete and clay masonry units, reinforced with glass FRP (GFRP) in different configurations. All the FRP-reinforced masonry walls showed a bilinear moment-deflection curve with one steep slope up to cracking of masonry and a decrease in stiffness after cracking. After failure occurred and as the out-of-plane load was progressively removed, the walls returned to a position close to the initial vertical position. The flexural design approach for FRP-reinforced walls provided good agreement with the experimental results. © 2022 American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved.},

A three-dimensional finite element analysis has been carried out performing a variation of dimensionless parameters (thickness ratio, size ratio and aspect ratio) exploring a wider range than other investigations. It is observed that the maximum value of the SCF increases as the hole size ratio and the aspect ratio increase, although the location of the maximum SCF is located from the internal area of the vessel to the external part depending on the geometric configuration, defining thus three differentiated zones. Additionally, in the final part of the document, a fit model is defined to determine the value of the maximum SCF for different continuous values of the defined dimensionless parameters. This model allows to quickly calculate or locate from a contour map the maximum value of SCF for a specific geometry of pressure vessel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Aim: To determine which acoustic parameters may be associated with vocal fatigue among college professors in Bogotá-Colombia. Method: This was a cross-sectional study including 27 voice samples of college professors. Results: A gender analysis showed that mean fundamental frequency increased significantly among men and women who reported vocal fatigue compared with the those without fatigue (138.2Hz vs 122.3Hz for males; and 228.7Hz vs 188.9Hz for females; Mann-Whitney U test P value <0.01). Participants with vocal fatigue demonstrated a significantly decreased standard deviation of vocal sound pressure level compared to participants without vocal fatigue (8.7 dB vs 10.2 dB; Mann-Whitney U test P value <0.01). For the males in our sample, fundamental frequency had fair discriminatory value for vocal fatigue (area under the curve = 0.7). Sensitivity and specificity were moderate at a cut-off of 125 Hz (0.7 and 0.6 respectively). For females in this sample, the discriminatory value of fundamental frequency was slightly higher (area under the curve = 0.8). At a cut-off of 200 Hz, sensitivity was high (0.9) and specificity were moderate (0.7). Conclusion: In conclusion, the fundamental frequencies and standard deviations of vocal sound pressure level are good indicators of and may be used to identify college professors with vocal fatigue. Clinically, voice clinicians may aim to train their clients to produce speech with a higher variation of “intensity” in order to avoid vocal fatigue. © 2020 The Voice Foundation},

The results showed a significant decrease in muscle activity compared to the condition without an exoskeleton. This decrease was 8% in Biceps Femoris (BF) muscle activity and 4% in Vastus Medialis (VM) muscle activity, generated by proper assistance of the devices thigh muscles. Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Lateral Gastrocnemius (LG) muscles and gait times did not show significant changes, which can be interpreted as a correct synchronisation of the devices with the person's gait.

The connected components of the complement of its singular locus provide its irreducible components. A Fuchsian description of the irreducible components of S1 ×(β1,β2 ) S2 is provided and, as a consequence, we obtain that if one of the maps βj is a regular branched covering, then all its irreducible components are isomorphic. Also, if both β1 and β2 are of finite degree, then we observe that the number of these irreducible components is bounded above by the greatest common divisor of the two degrees, and that such an upper bound is sharp. We also provide sufficient conditions for the irreducibility of the connected components of the fiber product. In the case that S0 =Ĉ, andS 1 and S2 are compact, we define the strong field of moduli of the pair (S1 ×(β1,β2 ) S2, β) and observe that this field coincides with the minimal field containing the fields of moduli of both pairs (S1, β1 ) and (S2, β2 ). Finally, in the case that all surfaces S1, S2 and S0 are compact and the fiber product is a connected Riemann surface, we observe that the Jacobian variety J(S1 ×(β1,β2 ) S2 ) × JS0 is isogenous to JS1 × JS2 × P, where P is a suitable abelian subvariety of J(S1 ×(β1,β2 ) S2 ). © 2022 American Mathematical Society.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) will help to decarbonize energy systems. However, their connection to on-board level 2 chargers (7.2 kW) at household facilities brings challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) as they can affect the power quality of low voltage (LV) networks. In order to truly assess these effects, the electrical behavior of the on-board charger in terms of its non-linear content, power demand, and charge rate must be understood first. Nonetheless, most modeling methodologies with this aim result in circuital approaches, and thus, in heavy computational burdens, or assume simplified representations that do not correspond to the reality of the charge. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to model the power quality characteristics of EVs based on measured data from the harmonic spectra of the charger. The model provides a precise and efficient electrical characterization, where probabilistic models of the harmonic spectra are used to compute the power demand during every stage of the charge. Due to its probabilistic nature, these harmonic spectra are represented using Gaussian Mixture Models. We validate the model contrasting simulated data versus real measured one. Then, we illustrate a case study of the model in a LV network power quality assessment with different EV penetration levels, considering time-series harmonic power flows with 10-min resolution under a Monte Carlo approach. Obtained results revealed an increase in the network chargeability and voltage unbalance, along with an increased content of the third harmonic, which appears to be the most intense. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Soft robotic approaches have been trialed for rehabilitation or assistive hand exoskeletons using silicone or textile actuators because they have more tolerance for alignment with biological joints than rigid exoskeletons. Textile actuators have not been previously evaluated, and this study compares the mechanical properties of textile and silicone actuators used in hand exoskeletons. The physical dimensions, the air pressure required to achieve a full bending motion, and the forces generated at the tip of the actuator were measured and compared. The results showed that the construction method of the silicone actuators is slower than the textile actuators, but it generates better dimensional accuracy. However, the air pressure required for the actuators to generate a full bending motion is significantly lower for textile actuators, and the blocking force generated at that pressure is 35% higher in the textile actuators. There are significant differences across all variables compared, indicating that actuators constructed using pleated textile techniques have greater potential for the construction of an exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation or assistance.

	abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of the cloud robotics paradigm, the literature on the field still lacks comprehensive analysis on several aspects of the technology. Therefore, the adoption of common standards and frameworks is fundamental for developing the field and allowing practical works to be reproduced and compared. This work presents a ROS-based open framework for robot-cloud communication, easing the integration of robotics and remote cloud platforms, and discusses the implementation of the overall cloud robotics stack over open source software and commercial off-the-shelf devices. Additionally, we present two practical implementations in which most of the computation is carried out remotely and perform a series of experiments to demonstrate our technique. Our results indicate that task times can be reduced up to 15% when using remote cloud platforms even under 150 ms average communication latency over the public Internet while observing figures as low as 2% on throughput loss in sensor data transmission. In general, such results point to the feasibility of the presented approach in different classes of applications, even under non-ideal network and cloud settings. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This article presents the assessment of the compressive strength of three types of lime mortar, one without admixtures and the remaining two added with metakaolin and brick dust. The chemical composition of the lime and the pozzolans was evaluated using the X-ray fluorescence technique. The mortars were subjected to two curing conditions: a humidity and temperature-controlled chamber and an accelerated carbonation chamber. Then, they were tested at the ages of 7, 28, 60, and 90 days. The results showed that the samples cured in the carbonation chamber had higher compressive strength values than the ones cured in the humidity and temperature-controlled chamber because lime mortars increase their strength with the carbonation of the calcium hydroxide present in the lime. Likewise, when adding metakaolin to the lime mortars cured in the humidity and temperature-controlled chamber, the compressive strength values were close to those of the mortars with lime only, which were cured in the carbonation chamber. From the results of this research, it is worth noting that the use of pozzolans in lime mortars improves the short-term compressive strength, which is attractive for the rehabilitation of heritage buildings, given that, in short periods of time, it manages to match the strengths that lime mortars acquire over time. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Consequently, it has been of great interest to develop rehabilitation and gait assistance solutions by medical and engineering professionals. Moreover, worldwide statistics report high incidence indicators of neurological and physical impairments, being a public health concern in several countries. In this sense, there are four types of assistive technologies that can be found in the field of rehabilitation engineering, focusing on human mobility: (1) wearable robots, (2) mobile robots, (3) social robots, and (4) combined platforms. Depending on the requirements of each user, these robotic devices aim to compensate, retrain, or provide the affected locomotion capabilities of the individual. This chapter defines these devices and describes their implementation in the context of gait assistance and rehabilitation. Similarly, it provides some evidence of applications in clinical scenarios. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202. All rights reseverd.},

	abstract = {Context: The challenges posed by the architecting of System of Systems (SoS) has motivated a significant number of research efforts in the area. However, literature is lacking when it comes to the interplay between the disciplines involved in the architecting process, a key factor in addressing these challenges. Objective: This paper aims to contribute to this line of research by confirming and extending previously characterized architecting harmonization practices from Systems and Software Engineering, adopted in an ultra-large-scale SoS. Methods: We conducted a confirmatory case study on the Square-Kilometre Array (SKA) project to evaluate and extend the findings of our exploratory case on the LOFAR/LOFAR2.0 radio-telescope projects. In doing so, a pre-study was conducted to map the findings of the previous study with respect to the SKA context. A survey was then designed, through which the views of 46 SKA engineers were collected and analyzed. Results: The study confirmed in various degrees the four practices identified in the exploratory case, and provided further insights about them: (1) the friction between disciplines caused by long-term system requirements, and how they can be ameliorated through intermediate, short-term requirements; (2) the way design choices with a cross-cutting impact on multiple agile teams have an indirect impact on the system architecture; (3) how these design choices are often caused by the criteria that guided early system decomposition; (4) the seemingly recurrent issue with the lack of details about the dynamic elements of the interfaces; and (5) the use of machine-readable interface specifications for aligning hardware/software development processes. Conclusions: The findings of this study and its predecessor support the importance of a cross-disciplinary view in the Software Engineering research agenda in SoS as a whole, not to mention their value as a convergence point for research on SoS architecting from the Systems and Software Engineering standpoints. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background:Intra-hospital falls have become an important public health problem globally. The use of movement sensors with alarms has been studied as elements with predictive capacity for falls at hospital level. However, in spite of their use in some hospitals throughout the world, evidence is lacking about their effectiveness in reducing intra-hospital falls. Therefore, this study aims to develop a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature exploring the impact of using sensors for fall prevention in hospitalized adults and the elderly population.Methods:We explored literature based on clinical trials in Spanish, English, and Portuguese, assessing the impact of devices used for hospital fall prevention in adult and elderly populations. The search included databases such as IEEE Xplore, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Science Direct databases. The critical appraisal was performed independently by two researchers. Methodological quality was assessed based on the ratings of individual biases. We performed the sum of the results, generating an estimation of the grouped effect (Relative Risk, 95% CI) for the outcome first fall for each patient. We assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. The study followed PRISMA guidelines.Results:Results were assessed in three randomized controlled clinical trials, including 29,691 patients. A total of 351 (3%) patients fell among 11,769 patients assigned to the intervention group, compared with 426 (2.4%) patients who fell among 17,922 patients assigned to the control group (general estimation RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04, 1.37, P=.02, I2=0%; Moderate GRADE).Conclusion:Our results show an increase of 19% in falls among elderly patients who are users of sensors located in their bed, bed-chair, or chair among their hospitalizations. Other types of sensors such as wearable sensors can be explored as coadjutants for fall prevention care in hospitals. © 2021 Authors. All rights reserved.},

This strategy will simplify the technical constraints that policy makers should establish and will facilitate the technical restrictions that Distribution System Operators (DSOs) should observe when determining how much energy prosumers can generate on the LV network without affecting the technical operation of the system. The study case is based on an existing LV network located in Bogota, Colombia with historical data of residential electric energy consumption modeled with OpenDSS. Environmental variables as irradiance and temperature are statistically treated with Easyfit, allowing to generate random data for supplying the OpenDSS model. Having the network model in OpenDSS and the stochastic data, a Python program is used to run multiple power flow simulations. The photovoltaic (PV) rated capacity of prosumers is adjusted to different percentages to evaluate the effects on the distribution system operation. This assessment allows to determine the maximum capacity that LV grid can host considering it is equally distributed among all the users.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In the modern era, the treatment and disposal of infectious waste should be seen as an opportunity to generate renewable energy, resource efficiency, and, above all, to improve the population's quality of life. Northern Italy currently produces 66,600 tons/year of infectious waste, mostly treated through incineration plants. This research aims to explore a more ecological and sustainable solution, thereby contributing one more step toward achieving better cities for all. Particularly, this paper presents a conceptual design of the main sterilization chamber for infectious waste. The methodology selected was Design Thinking (DT), since it has a user-centered approach which allows for co-design and the inclusion of the target population.

Robot-assisted physical rehabilitation, which has a strong component of gait rehabilitation, provides considerable advantages over conventional therapies regarding patient's motor control, balance, and cardiovascular parameters. However, it is believed that the inclusion of a cognitive approach in these rehabilitation therapies can bring even more benefits to the patients and all other personals involved. Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) has been used in the last years as a tool to incorporate these cognitive aspects in physical rehabilitation (PR) processes. This chapter explores the basic concepts of social robotics and its role in PR, through the explanation and development of Patient-Robot interfaces. A case study of a robot-assisted PR with Lokomat presents the promising results of including SAR in gait rehabilitation, by improving patient's motivation, engagement, and overall performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

To achieve a clearer understanding of the surface performance of those biomedical alloys and the role of the surface properties in the mechanical and chemical performance, samples were taken from retrieval implants made of Ti6Al4V and Co28Cr6Mo alloys. Polarization resistance and pin-on-disk tests were performed on these samples. Physical properties such as contact angle, roughness, microhardness, and Young’s modulus were determined. A correlation between surface energy and evolution of the tribological contact was observed for both biomedical alloys. In tribocorrosion tests, titanium particles seem to remain in the surface, unlike what is observed in CoCr alloys. These metallic or oxidized particles could cause necrosis or adverse tissue reactions. © IMechE 2021.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Methods based on deep learning have recently been applied to recover astrophysical parameters, thanks to the ability of these techniques to capture information from complex data. One of these schemes is the approximate Bayesian neural network (BNN), which has demonstrated to yield a posterior distribution into the parameter space that is extremely helpful for uncertainty quantification. However, modern neural networks tend to produce overly confident uncertainty estimates and introduce bias when applying BNNs to data. Method: In this work, we implement multiplicative normalizing flows (MNFs), a family of approximate posteriors for the parameters of BNNs with the purpose of enhancing the flexibility of the variational posterior distribution, to extract Ωm, h, and σ8 from the QUIJOTE simulations. We compared the latter method with the standard BNNs and the Flipout estimator. Results: We have found that the use of MNFs consistently outperforms the standard BNNs with a percent difference in the mean squared error of 21%, in addition to high-accuracy extraction of σ8 (r2 = 0.99), with precise and consistent uncertainty estimates. Discussions: These findings imply that MNFs provide a more realistic predictive distribution closer to the true posterior, mitigating the bias introduced by the variational approximation and allowing us to work with well-calibrated networks.

	abstract = {Purpose: The main contribution of the research is to propose a quantitative model based on indicators designed by the authors, to measure the effect on the performance of the process caused by an improvement in the integration of information. Design/methodology/approach: It is a descriptive and exploratory investigation, immersed in a case study; the bidding process was selected by senior management due to the high complexity and impact of this process on the organization. The protocol for carrying out the study involved interviews with the owner of the process and all the officials involved, as sources of information, inputs to model in BPMN2.0 at the activity level and a statistical validation of the model was carried out, to sustain an acceptable confidence of the same. Findings: Among the most outstanding results of the research are that the effects of the improvements or changes in the activities were reflected or evidenced in subsequent activities, not in the immediate ones or in which the improvement is applied. This confirms the theorization of the systemic approach to processes since the effects of the improvements are not close to their application. Research limitations/implications: For the proposed model, it was evident that the measurement of the efficiency and quality dimensions of the process activities required verification in transactional databases where nonconformities and nonquality costs related to orders are recorded. Originality/value: In the reviewed literature, there are no models or reference frameworks that quantitatively measure the effects of the integration of information on the performance of processes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Social assistive robotics in autism has been implemented in studies and therapies to improve social skills and encourage children to comply with therapies. However, autism symptoms vary in their spectrum, which generates difficulties in implementing social robotics in a general way. In this study, the CASTOR social robot was implemented in three cases: one case of autism fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and two cases with comorbidities typically excluded in social robotic studies. A pre and post-test professional evaluations were made, and 12 variables about social skills were measured during the implementation. Four sessions of 30 minutes were performed for each study case, improving focal attention, following instructions, working and procedure memory, identifying emotions, and physical and verbal imitation. Regarding the qualification method used at the Howard Gardner Clinic for each speciality, the most remarkable improvements were P1 increased by 20% in physiotherapy, P2 increased by 23% in psychology and P3 increased by 10% in occupational therapy. The pre and posttest results indicate that the presence of the social robot in therapies improves children's progress independently of their qualities. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to determine how a strategic innovation framework that integrates the concepts of innovation function, dynamic performance management (DPM) and system-dynamics (SD) modelling can measure performance in a supply chain (SC). Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a strategic innovation framework for an SC by considering three steps. First, a systemic intervention is presented based on the innovation functions that influence SC performance. Second, an analysis of the system's performance is proposed. Third, a model SD-based simulation is designed. The developed framework is explained by employing a case study of the Colombian pig sector SC. Findings: The results reveal that identifying and synchronising the system's performance drivers associated with the innovation functions could improve the inventory in the SC. Practical implications: On the one hand, managers can use the proposed framework to evaluate the innovation investments and understand their impact on operation performance (e.g. on inventories). On the other hand, policymakers may support decision-making to improve policy design (e.g. through investment in R&D). Originality/value: Few studies discuss the impacts of innovation functions on SC performance. This paper aims to fill this theoretical gap and to contribute to the literature by suggesting a novel framework which includes innovation functions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Objective: to propose a methodological guide to improve the disposal cycles of disposable masks, involving stakeholders and applying the Systemic Design methodology. Materials and methods: the methodology used included the collection of data through a Kano survey applied in different departments of Colombia. Remote interviews were conducted with experts in waste management. From these activities, it was possible to identify the different disposal methods used in Colombia. Results: a methodological guide that allows the correct arrangement of the masks, based on what was obtained with the application of the phases of Systemic Design, and the construction of the circular graphic that allows waste to return to the system. Conclusions: the research made it possible to identify thatthe correct disposition of the masks does not depend exclusively on the awareness of the communities, but also on the commitment of the industries involved; we hope that this study will be useful for future research. © 2021 Corporacion Universitaria Lasallista.

	abstract = {Currently, many useful robotic devices have been used in daily therapeutic life. These assistive and social robots are widely explored in different areas and scenarios, which have allowed physical or cognitive interaction with patients. Likewise, social robots have been recently implemented as a tool to improve the procedure's quality and support patients to boost their performance. However, to achieve these goals, it is important to understand how users, namely patients and clinicians who mostly know the needs and the therapy environment, perceive this technology. In this context, this chapter focuses on assessing the clinician's and patient's experience, acceptability, and perception using robotic platforms in a clinical setup. Several metrics are used to assess this perception and the critical components from a clinical view to ensure adaptation to the technology. Some of these tools are presented in this chapter, and three cases where these tools were used in different moments of the research process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

This reactor allows growing any type of chalcogenide compound by chalcogenisation of their metal precursors. However its performance was tested by depositing CuSbS2 films by chalcogenisation of metal precursors sequentially deposited by evaporation. The sulfurization process includes soft annealing of the Sb/Cu stacked precursor in a controlled atmosphere mixture of argon and hydrogen gas (95% Ar and 5% H2) followed by heating in the presence of elemental sulfur, using a tubular furnace heated with infrared lamps. Chalcogenisation process is carried out by controlling the heating rate of the furnace with the help of algorithms developed using LabVIEW programming environment. Through a study of deposition parameters that included the variables, furnace heating rate, final annealing target temperature and annealing time, conditions were found to grow single-phase CuSbS2 films with good structural, optical and morphological properties. This indicates that the CuSbS2 films prepared by means the chalcogenisation routine developed in this work, could be used later as an absorbent layer in solar cells. © 2021 The Author(s)},

As these technologies spread around the world, standard ways to assess their performance become a necessity to accurately prescribe and treat patients. Even though efforts have been made to harmonize these assessments, they include many possible variables and many disciplines that complicate the process. This contribution takes over the recent attempts to constitute a benchmark for bipedal locomotion and presents the key concepts to correctly assess robotic devices for gait assistance and rehabilitation. The first part of the contribution focuses on the definition of the basic terminology to understand the area, including the concepts of motor skill, abilities, and performance. The motor skills are then classified to understand the possible variables to consider when assessing the performance of the devices, which is very challenging due to the intrinsic interaction with the subjects. The performance indicators used in the field are presented and linked to the equipment and sensors commonly chosen to measure them, with concrete examples of the technologies implemented in significant research contributions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

	abstract = {In the latest years, there has been a rise in social robotics’ interest as a support tool in various scopes. For instance, social robots have been used in Autism treatments, improving social skills, social interaction, and children’s daily activities performance. Although several studies elucidate the benefits of social robots in the ASD community, few focus on evaluating and promoting physical interaction. Thus, this study presents the development and assessment of a social robotic platform based on soft actuation to promote physical interaction. A total of 35 children diagnosed with autism were involved in this study. The primary outcomes show that physical interaction does not significantly influence the patient’s performance in the activity. However, the clinicians remark that encouragement and motivation increase when the children were allowed to interact with the robot physically. Also, 52.9% of the control group children elucidate the intention of physically interact with the robot, suggesting this behavior is an essential way of communication. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

On the one hand, it is necessary to mathematically model these devices to obtain a kinematic description of their spatial behavior.

Finally, it is also of great relevance to know the sensory architectures used by each robot. These allow the device to acquire information from itself and the environment.

	abstract = {The constant growth of the population with mobility impairments, such as older adults and people suffering from neurological pathologies like Parkinson's disease (PD), has encouraged the development of multiple devices for gait assistance. Robotic walkers have emerged, improving physical stability and balance and providing cognitive aid in rehabilitation scenarios. Different studies evaluated human gait behavior with passive and active walkers to understand such rehabilitation processes. However, there is no evidence in the literature of studies with robotic walkers in daily living scenarios with older adults with Parkinson's disease. This study presents the assessment of the AGoRA Smart Walker using Ramps Tests and Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT). Ten older adults participated in the study, four had PD, and the remaining six had underlying conditions and fractures. Each of them underwent a physical assessment (i.e., Senior Fitness, hip, and knee strength tests) and then interacted with the AGoRA SW. Kinematic and physical interaction data were collected through the AGoRA walker's sensory interface. It was found that for lower limb strength tests, older adults with PD had increases of at least 15% in all parameters assessed. For the Sit to Stand Test, the Parkinson's group evidenced an increase of 23%, while for the Chair Sit and Reach Test (CSRT), this same group was only 0.04 m away from reaching the target. For the Ramp Up Test (RUT), the subjects had to make a greater effort, and significant differences (p-value = 0.04) were evidenced in the force they applied to the device. For the Ramp Down Test (RDT), the Parkinson's group exhibited a decrease in torque, and there were statistically significant differences (p-value = 0.01) due to the increase in the complexity of the task. In the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), the subjects presented significant differences in torque (p-value of 0.05) but not in force (p-value of 0.22) due to the effect of the admittance controller implemented in the study. Finally, the results suggested that the walker, represents a valuable tool for assisting people with gait motor deficits in tasks that demanded more physical effort adapting its behavior to the specific needs of each user.

	abstract = {Introduction: In the past years, robotic lower-limb exoskeletons have become a powerful tool to help clinicians improve the rehabilitation process of patients who have suffered from neurological disorders, such as stroke, by applying intensive and repetitive training. However, active subject participation is considered to be an important feature to promote neuroplasticity during gait training. To this end, the present study presents the performance assessment of the AGoRA exoskeleton, a stance-controlled wearable device designed to assist overground walking by unilaterally actuating the knee and hip joints. Methods: The exoskeleton’s control approach relies on an admittance controller, that varies the system impedance according to the gait phase detected through an adaptive method based on a hidden Markov model. This strategy seeks to comply with the assistance-as-needed rationale, i.e., an assistive device should only intervene when the patient is in need by applying Human-Robot interaction (HRI). As a proof of concept of such a control strategy, a pilot study comparing three experimental conditions (i.e., unassisted, transparent mode, and stance control mode) was carried out to evaluate the exoskeleton’s short-term effects on the overground gait pattern of healthy subjects. Gait spatiotemporal parameters and lower-limb kinematics were captured using a 3D-motion analysis system Vicon during the walking trials. Results and Discussion: By having found only significant differences between the actuated conditions and the unassisted condition in terms of gait velocity (ρ = 0.048) and knee flexion (ρ ≤ 0.001), the performance of the AGoRA exoskeleton seems to be comparable to those identified in previous studies found in the literature. This outcome also suggests that future efforts should focus on the improvement of the fastening system in pursuit of kinematic compatibility and enhanced compliance.

The addition of fibers to the matrix allows the development of adequate behavior to direct tension and bending. However, their main back drawn is its high initial cost and its high carbon footprint. To address those issues this research aims to analyze the behavior of a previously optimized eco-friendly recycled glass ultra-high-performance concrete under flexural stress by using locally available low-cost synthetic fiber reinforcement. Besides, high-strength steel fibers were used to establish a comparison. The experimental program involved 34 dosages of UHPFRC. The results showed that, contrary to what happens with the high strength fiber, no one of the synthetic series with 1% of fiber volume fraction achieved the deflection hardening condition. However, several synthetic fibers series achieved that condition with a 2% of fiber volume fraction. Furthermore, the results also showed that the polypropylene fibers, the polypropylene/polyethylene fibers, and the hybrid combination of PVA and polypropylene/polyethylene fibers, outperformed the high strength steel fibers regarding the cost-benefit analysis for the toughness of a UHPFRC with 2% total volume fiber. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, several strategies for treating neuropsychologic function loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been proposed, such as physical activity performance and developing games to exercise the mind. However, few studies illustrate the incidence of these therapies in neuronal activity. This work aims to study the feasibility of a virtual reality-based program oriented to the cognitive functions’ rehabilitation of PD patients. For this, the study was divided into intervention with the program, acquisition of signals, data processing, and results analysis. The alpha and beta bands’ power behavior was determined by evaluating the electroencephalography (EEG) signals obtained during the execution of control tests and games of the “Hand Physics Lab” Software, from which five games related to attention, planning, and sequencing, concentration, and coordination were taken. Results showed the characteristic performance of the cerebral bands during resting states and activity states. In addition, it was determined that the beta band increased its activity in all the cerebral lobes in all the tested games (p-value < 0.05). On the contrary, just one game exhibited an adequate performance of the alpha band activity of the temporal and frontal lobes (p-value < 0.02). Furthermore, the visual attention and the capacity to process and interpret the information given by the surroundings was favored during the execution of trials (p-value < 0.05); thus, the efficacy of the virtual reality program to recover cognitive functions was verified. The study highlights implementing new technologies to rehabilitate people with neurodegenerative diseases. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The determination of the eventual abrupt fracture of a reinforced concrete structure is of fundamental importance to estimate and mitigate the possible damages caused by its failure; of particular importance are shear-type fractures since these usually lead to sudden failure of the structure. One way to determine the presence of shear-type micro-cracks is by parametric analysis of the acoustic emissions produced by the micro-cracks during their growth. In this analysis, a direct comparisson of the waveform allows a distinction to be made between tensile-type and shear-type events. In the present study, we performed a comparative analysis of fracture processes in two reinforced concrete walls. In one of the walls an out-of-plane force was applied leading to bending and a non-abrupt failure; in the other one diagonal forces were applied leading to an abrupt shear-type fracture. Acoustic emissions were detected throughout and we found that at least one of the parameters associated with the parametric analysis allows distinguishing between abrupt and non-abrupt failures. Our results suggest that parametric analysis of acoustic emissions could be a useful tool in the prediction of abrupt failures in reinforced concrete structures. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {Physical exercise contributes to the success of rehabilitation programs and rehabilitation processes assisted through social robots. However, the amount and intensity of exercise needed to obtain positive results are unknown. Several considerations must be kept in mind for its imple-mentation in rehabilitation, as monitoring of patients’ intensity, which is essential to avoid extreme fatigue conditions, may cause physical and physiological complications. The use of machine learning models has been implemented in fatigue management, but is limited in practice due to the lack of understanding of how an individual’s performance deteriorates with fatigue; this can vary based on physical exercise, environment, and the individual’s characteristics. As a first step, this paper lays the foundation for a data analytic approach to managing fatigue in walking tasks. The proposed framework establishes the criteria for a feature and machine learning algorithm selection for fatigue management, classifying four fatigue diagnoses states. Based on the proposed framework and the classifier implemented, the random forest model presented the best performance with an average accuracy of ≥98% and F-score of ≥93%. This model was comprised of ≤16 features. In addition, the prediction performance was analyzed by limiting the sensors used from four IMUs to two or even one IMU with an overall performance of ≥88%. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Few companies in the Colombian floriculture sector manage their inventories, causing stock breaks, causing downtime in key post-harvest operations, causing non-compliance with sales orders and damage to the flower. For this reason, the general objective is to simulate the inventory process handled in the postharvest of rose (Rosa sp.), to find opportunities for improvement. This research work was a case study carried out in an export company of rose bouquets from Cundinamarca, the province with the largest volume of export-type flower production at the national level. The rose postharvest was selected by the indicators of low production. Because this is a descriptive and exploratory investigation, a modeling of the inventory process was carried out, with the help of the managers and an analysis of times and probability of occurrence of the tasks involved. Subsequently, the simulation was done with the inventory process cycle time in Bizagi Modeler®, making a total of 36 réplicas. This resulted in a total inventory process cycle time of 9,684 minutes for the Valentine's season, finding that 44 % of the activities can be optimized. Finally, it is concluded that, with the simulation of the inventory process, non-value- added activities can be found, serving as an input in the development of improvement strategies. © 2023 Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria Corpoica.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this work is to analyze the petroleum industry from the perspective of sustainability, taking into account its three dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Likewise, the objective is to identify and propose factors of sustainability, in other words, categories or subdivisions that allow us to analyze in greater detail the interactions and the effects of this industry on society, which must be evaluated in each of the three dimensions for the oil sector. Design/methodology: This research was carried out by means of a systematic review of the literature, with a qualitative focus of an analytic/interpretive nature. A four-phase protocol was used for the search, using the guidelines of the PRISMA statement as a reference. This protocol describes the article selection criteria, search strategy, data extraction and procedures and tools used for the analysis. Findings: The review reveals the need to establish a consensus on the sustainability factors that must be evaluated in each of the dimensions within the oil sector, given that the results of the search show that there is no clear definition or correlation with regard to the environmental, social and economic impact in the oil-producing regions. Most of the works identified were designed as case studies and a large majority of the results of the studies are contradictory, even showing adverse effects, while others fail to identify any hazards. Originality/value: The most relevant contribution of this work is related to the identification of specific sustainability factors for the oil industry, which make it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of their influence on the three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic development, environmental aspects and social aspects. This classification according to factors is important in order to provide a cross-cutting conceptual framework that is applicable to any region or situation where the problems are being analyzed that derive from oil exploitation © Article's contents are provided on an Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 Creative commons International License.

Drying paths in soils are produced by water uptake by plants or by evaporation due to extreme seasonal changes. This study presents the results of geotechnical centrifuge tests on the effect of water content on deformations and on the failure mechanism of a slope in fine soil. The failure mechanism and the resulting displacements obtained in the experiments were determined using image analysis using the GeoPIV_RG software. The results show a significant effect of soil suction on the failure mechanism. For saturated soils, the slope suffers an abrupt failure mechanism due to shear strength, while for partially saturated soils, this mechanism is modified and the magnitude of deformations diminishes as soil suction increases. Meanwhile, the size of the traction crack decreases as suction levels increase due to the increase in tensile strength produced by the loss of water content. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The expansion of urban land in Latin American cities has been extensive over the last 30 years. Urbanisation has grown considerably, and, according to the United Nations, it is expected that approximately 70% of the population will live in large cities by the year 2050. This process leads to more complex urban relations, more intense suburbanisation, larger settlements in the peripheral areas of cities and, subsequently, a significant reduction of urban green infrastructure. The aim of this paper is to assess whether the expansion areas defined in different planning instruments generate urban inclusion and are aligned with the already consolidated urban area. The case study areas are represented by the municipalities of Chía and Cajicá in the northern suburbs of Bogotá city, which have a strong integration with the central city. The methodology integrates data from municipal land use plans and the spatial syntax method to visualise the effect of expansion on urban morphology. The results obtained show that Chía presents an area of greater integration than Cajicá, specifically the centre of the municipality, in which there is a high level of functionality with respect to the new expansion areas defined in the Master Plan. This study concludes that the new expansion areas should be developed on the central axes, where the highest integration values are located, and at a greater distance from natural elements such as rivers. Finally, the methodological approach can be replicated to analyse other urban areas and support decision-making on urban functionality and expansion. © 2022, Centre for Research on Settlements and Urbanism, Faculty of Geography, Babes-Bolyai University.

This method quantifies the difference of orientation between the user’s limb and the exoskeleton link, providing a deeper understanding of the Human–Robot interaction. To this end, the AGoRA exoskeleton was configured in a resistive mode and assessed using an optoelectronic system. The interaction quantified a difference of orientation considerably at a maximum value of 41.1 degrees along the sagittal plane. It extended the understanding of the Human–Robot Interaction throughout the three principal human planes.

It was found that the deficit of the Government Treasury and the net disbursements of TES securities were regularly compensated by the monetary operations of the Bank of the Republic, which evidenced the capacity of the issuer to control short- and medium-term interest rates, as described by the MMT. Despite the self-legal restrictions for the issuer to finance the government, the results presented validate the coordination of the fiscal and monetary operations proposed by the MMT.

	abstract = {Introduction: The rise of soft robotics has driven the development of devices for assistance in activities of daily living (ADL). Likewise, different types of actuation have been developed for safer human interaction. Recently, textile-based pneumatic actuation has been introduced in hand exoskeletons for features such as biocompatibility, flexibility, and durability. These devices have demonstrated their potential use in assisting ADLs, such as the degrees of freedom assisted, the force exerted, or the inclusion of sensors. However, performing ADLs requires the use of different objects, so exoskeletons must provide the ability to grasp and maintain stable contact with a variety of objects to lead to the successful development of ADLs. Although textile-based exoskeletons have demonstrated significant advancements, the ability of these devices to maintain stable contact with a variety of objects commonly used in ADLs has yet to be fully evaluated. Materials and methods: This paper presents the development and experimental validation in healthy users of a fabric-based soft hand exoskeleton through a grasping performance test using The Anthropomorphic Hand Assessment Protocol (AHAP), which assesses eight types of grasping with 24 objects of different shapes, sizes, textures, weights, and rigidities, and two standardized tests used in the rehabilitation processes of post- stroke patients. Results and discussion: A total of 10 healthy users (45.50 ± 14.93 years old) participated in this study. The results indicate that the device can assist in developing ADLs by evaluating the eight types of grasps of the AHAP. A score of 95.76 ± 2.90% out of 100% was obtained for the Maintaining Score, indicating that the ExHand Exoskeleton can maintain stable contact with various daily living objects. In addition, the results of the user satisfaction questionnaire indicated a positive mean score of 4.27 ± 0.34 on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5.

	abstract = {Unreinforced masonry (URM) walls are prone to a brittle failure when subjected to out-of-plane and in-plane forces caused by seismic events. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials offer an economical and viable solution for the seismic retrofit of URM to increase their resistance to in-plane and out-of-plane forces. This paper presents the results of an experimental program that aimed to determine the in-plane shear performance of unreinforced concrete masonry walls strengthened with different levels of externally applied Carbon and Glass FRP composites. All the wall specimens were tested under in-plane cyclic loading with increasing intensity. The test set-up configuration consisted of double-height walls loaded at the mid-height. A total of five specimens (one control, two carbon, and two glass) were tested with increasing amounts of FRP and different layouts. The FRP was applied to one face of the walls to simulate field conditions where access to only one face of the wall is possible. The ultimate shear strength, lateral deformation, and peak load were compared for all tested walls. In most cases, failure occurred in either the masonry or the epoxy and in no case did the FRP reach its ultimate capacity. The experimental results demonstrated that a significant increase in the in-plane shear capacity of masonry can be achieved for walls retrofitted with Glass and Carbon FRP. Ultimate shear strengths of the walls were compared with those determined using the design model in ACI 440.7R for predicting the in-plane shear capacity of CMU walls. A good correlation between experimental results and theoretical predictions was observed. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.},

	abstract = {Surgical devices and tools are manufactured in AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel, due to its hardenability, adequate hardness and acceptable biocompatibility. Nevertheless, many surface modification strategies are being investigated with a view to improving this material by providing it with self-protection against the colonization of bacteria. One such strategy is the use of a TiAlVN-Ag nanocomposite coating to promote bactericidal effect in surgical devices; however, it is necessary to study the electrochemical response of such coatings to aggressive environments that simulate disinfection and sterilization processes. The aim of this work is to study the relationship between the microstructure, chemical phases and the electrochemical and corrosion response of TiAlVN-Ag coating, varying the amount of silver with the target power increase (0, 50, 70, 80 and 100 W). To study the microstructure, chemical phases, scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were used. Roughness, microhardness, residual stresses, qualitative adhesion of coatings were estimated by atomic force microscopy, Knoop indentation, profilometer and Rockwell C indentation, respectively. Electrochemical behavior and corrosion protection of coatings were studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization. TiAlVN-Ag 50W coating showed an improvement in electrochemical behavior and in protection of the steel against corrosion and exhibiting higher hardness than that of the AISI 420 stainless steel substrates. This coating exhibited a dense microstructure and high crystallinity, indicating that the low Ag content does not affect the insulating nature of the coating matrix. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The addition of mill scale, an important steel making byproduct, as pigment to fired clay bricks was investigated, as well as its effects on the physical, mechanical and microstructural properties. For this purpose, bricks were manufactured using clay from the Cundiboyacense highlands -a geographic region of Colombia- with the addition of mill scale at 0, 5, 10 and 15%. Once the bricks had been sintered, their density, porosity, water absorption, compressive and flexural resistance were measured. In addition, microstructural analysis using X-ray diffraction, as well as thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analyses, were carried out on the four types of bricks, to facilitate comparison between them. Variations in hue between the four types of bricks, from dull orange to grayish red, an average decrease in flexural strength of 33% and an increase in average porosity of 4% compared to traditional bricks were observed. Furthermore, it was found that the added mill scale does not react chemically with the clay, being a stable addition. Additionally, mill scale oxidizes to hematite during the firing of the bricks, ultimately becoming a good pigment that changes its hue depending on the added quantity. Therefore, it was concluded that the addition of mill scale to bricks enables the reuse of this industrial by-product and reduces the consumption of clay (which is a non-renewable resource), while complying with minimum standards of compressive strength, flexural strength and porosity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Stroke disease leads to a partial or complete disability affecting muscle strength and functional mobility. Early rehabilitation sessions might induce neuroplasticity and restore the affected function or structure of the patients. Robotic rehabilitation minimizes the burden on therapists by providing repetitive and regularly monitored therapies. Commercial exoskeletons have been found to assist hip and knee motion. For instance, unilateral exoskeletons have the potential to become an effective training system for patients with hemiparesis. However, these robotic devices leave the ankle joint unassisted, essential in gait for body propulsion and weight-bearing. This article evaluates the effects of the robotic ankle orthosis T-FLEX during cooperative assistance with the AGoRA unilateral lower-limb exoskeleton (hip and knee actuation). This study involves nine subjects, measuring muscle activity and gait parameters such as stance and swing times. The results showed a reduction in muscle activity in the Biceps Femoris of 50%, Lateral Gastrocnemius of 59% and Tibialis Anterior of 35% when adding T-FLEX to the AGoRA unilateral lower-limb exoskeleton. No differences were found in gait parameters. Nevertheless, stability is preserved when comparing the two legs. Future works should focus on evaluating the devices in ground tests in healthy subjects and pathological patients. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Stroke is a medical condition characterized by the rapid loss of focal brain function. Post-stroke patients attend rehabilitation training to prevent the degeneration of physical function and improve upper limb movements and functional status after stroke. Promising rehabilitation therapies include functional electrical stimulation (FES), exergaming, and virtual reality (VR). This work presents a biomechanical assessment of 13 post-stroke patients with hemiparesis before and after rehabilitation therapy for two months with these three methods. Patients performed two tests (Maximum Forward Reach and Apley Scratching) where maximum angles, range of motion, angular velocities, and execution times were measured. A Wilcoxon test was performed (p = 0.05) to compare the variables before and after the therapy for paretic and non-paretic limbs. Significant differences were found in range of motion in flexion–extension, adduction–abduction, and internal–external rotation of the shoulder. Increases were found in flexion–extension, 17.98%, and internal–external rotation, 18.12%, after therapy in the Maximum Forward Reach Test. For shoulder adduction– abduction, the increase found was 20.23% in the Apley Scratching Test, supporting the benefits of rehabilitation therapy that combines FES, exergaming, and VR in the literature. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a cement-based material whose superior mechanical and durability features are ascribed to its enhanced microstructure. Nonetheless, large amounts of cement and other expensive components are usually necessary to achieve that particular microstructure, leading to higher costs and carbon footprint than standard concretes. Even though several pieces of research have focused on the employ of mineral admixtures as partial replacement of cement and silica fume while maintaining a compressive strength of over 150 MPa, there is a lack of knowledge on how these additions affect other properties of UHPC. This research paper aims to fill that gap in the Colombian case by analyzing the mechanical properties (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity) and durability (ultrasonic pulse velocity, volume of permeable voids, and chloride ion penetration) of two optimized, cost-efficient, and eco-friendly UHPC dosages containing locally available and low-cost mineral admixtures, encompassing two economically viable milled waste glass powders with an average particle size of 7 and 28 microns, and limestone powder. The results were compared with those obtained for a control mixture, which contained high amounts of cement and silica fume as cementitious materials. The conclusions showed that limestone and recycled glass powders reduce both the high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWRA) and the time of the mixing procedure, leading to a relevant decrease in the production costs. Cost-efficient and eco-friendly UHPCs’ mechanical and durability properties were minor but in the same range as the reference mixture. However, the UHPC dosage incorporating limestone and 28-micron glass powders implied a reduction in cement by 31% and material costs by 32.5% from the reference. In comparison, the dosage in that addition contained 7 microns of glass powder which led to a lessening of 29% in cement and 33.5% in final costs. These outcomes endorsed using limestone and recycled glass powders to develop low-cost and eco-friendly UHPC in Colombia. Copyright © 2022, American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved.},

The influence of the presence of reinforcement was studied on physical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Physical characterization showed that fiber presence increased the density compared to the resin; the moisture content in the composites was not significantly affected, and the water absorption increased due to the presence of Manicaria fiber. The fiber volume fraction was 0.23, and the void content was 3.9%. Thermal analysis showed that the degradation process of the composites started in the same temperature range as the resin. The composite improved the flexural strength and modulus by 36% and 28%, respectively. Manicaria fiber has good potential as a reinforcement for composite materials. © 2022 Porras et al.},

	abstract = {Direct tensile behavior is one of the most relevant properties of ultrahigh-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC). However, the determination of this behavior implies the realization of complex tests that must be carried out by experienced personnel because small variations could invalidate the results. This research purpose was to develop and compare two different algorithmic approaches for the direct tensile behavior of UHPFRC. Thereby, the cracking tensile strength σcc, the tensile postcracking capacity σpc and its associated strains, εcc, and εpc, were modeled by means of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and artificial neural networks (ANN). Four ANN models, one for each response, and four LASSO models were created to produce the most accurate approaches. Results showed the reliability of the developed models through statistical indices such as the root of the mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error, normalized mean bias error, the ratio of the RMSE to the standard deviation of measured data, coefficient of efficiency, and coefficient of determination (R2). Besides, the analytical research also showed that the highest accuracy belongs to ANN models, with R2 values of.922,.807,.901, and.858, in forecasting the features of direct tensile behavior of UHPFRC (σcc, εcc, σpc, and εpc).

In the manufacturing context, this revolution allows improving the efficiency and productivity of manufacturing operations through the deployment of technological advances. One of the main concerns of society is the human well-being in the workplace environment. Despite the advances in the manufacturing domain, humans will continue to have certain levels of involvement in manufacturing operations. Still, for an adequate human-system synchronization, it is needed to understand the human representation, interaction, and contribution on advanced manufacturing systems, without threatening the human well-being. For this reason, this paper reviews the role of the human operator, examining the representation, interaction, involvement, and capabilities of the human in manufacturing systems. This exploratory research analyses the evolution of the human operator, considering the type of human inclusion, the human/virtual-environment communication, the human factors indicators, the virtual representation, the purpose of the virtual representation and the devices/measurements of human factors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The higher number of constituents, together with a higher number of possible combinations, relative proportioning and characteristics, makes the behavior of this type of concrete more difficult to predict. The objective of the research is to build four analytical models, based on artificial neural networks (ANN), to predict the 1-day, 7-day, and 28-day compressive strengths and slump flow. Recycled glass powder milled to different particle size, fluid catalytic cracking residue (FCC) and different particle size limestone powder was used as partial replacements for Portland cement and silica fume. The ANN models predicted the 1-day, 7-day, and 28-day compressive strengths and slump flow of the test set with prediction error values (RMSE) of 2.400 MPa, 2.638 MPa, 2.064 MPa and 7.245 mm respectively. The results indicated that the developed ANN models are an efficient tool for predicting the slump flow and compressive strengths of UHPC while incorporating silica fume, limestone powder, recycled glass powder and FCC. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency is a widely studied topic not only from a technical perspective but also from a technological transfer one. Few research works focus on energy consumption habits of household consumers, through the measurement of typical household devices, for later collection and processing by means of a self-implemented wireless energy meter. When the owners of a residential building receive their monthly electric energy bill, the information does not discriminate the consumption behaviour of household appliances and loads. Furthermore, the behaviour of energy consumption at separate times of the day or week is not directly inferred. If consumers were able to identify those devices which have a higher consumption based on historical consumption data or baseline consumption, they could take actions that effectively impact its electrical energy consumption. Due to the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with high capabilities for data acquisition and analysis, the inference process has improved in the last few years. Since the user's decision-making actions to reduce the electrical monthly energy consumption are supported on better analysis, proper actions are expected. This novel contribution describes the design methodology and the implementation of a system that integrates energy measurement techniques through IoT networks, providing the user with detailed information regarding their electrical energy consumption behaviour. Additionally, field measurements are analysed for households located in Bogotá, Colombia.  © 2022 UniversitÃ},

	abstract = {Despite their common origin, experiments show that acoustic and electromagnetic emissions evolve in different ways during the fracture processes of brittle materials. It is common to find peaks of acoustic activity without the presence of electromagnetic emissions and vice versa, it is possible to find high electromagnetic radiation without significant acoustic activity. As far as we know, there are currently no models that explain these discrepancies in a simple way. In this work we propose a minimal model that is able to generate the frequently observed discrepancies between acoustic and electromagnetic emissions during fracture processes of brittle materials. The model is an electrical version of the fiber bundle model where the fibers are replaced by fuses in a resistor. The resistors are placed on a Wheatstone bridge subjected to a gradually increasing voltage. A capacitor is added to generate charge and discharge processes that will generate the electromagnetic emissions, while the breaking of the fuses will generate the acoustic emissions. The model allows to follow the evolution of acoustic and electromagnetic activities and shows that, despite their common origin, the two phenomena evolve differently. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In general, multiple sensing technologies are available to acquire gait information. Among these are sensing devices involving inertial sensors, ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, and plantar pressure sensors. From the information provided by these devices, it is possible to calculate spatiotemporal gait parameters such as cadence, speed, step length, among others. It is also possible to detect and characterize the phases of the gait cycle. Accordingly, this chapter presents a description of the most relevant gait indicators and some wearable sensors that allow their acquisition. Finally, there are described two usage scenarios for a lower-limb exoskeleton and a robotic walker. These scenarios describe two methodologies to extract gait parameters from an inertial sensor and a laser rangefinder. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a problem that has been increasing in recent years due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics. However, more techniques to design new medicines are employed frequently nowadays. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence tools in discovering new drugs has proven to be a possible solution to this problem. This paper aims to show and analyze the results obtained from the use of machine learning techniques when two different sets of features: i) constructed from Lipinski’s rules of five, and ii) fingerprints from biomolecular sequences, were used. Six regressors were implemented to predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) valuer to generate models that allow the identification of possible drugs. A specific case for inhibition of the Staphylococcus Aureus and its protein NorA was studied in problems associated to Quinolone antibiotic resistance. A dataset of 187 sequences extracted from ChEmbl repository was used for this purpose. The results show that both Lipinski rules and fingerprints were favorable for generation models that fit actual MIC values of the molecules. The feature sets used and the regressors selected allowed generating models that can predict the bioactivity of a molecule, constituting a tool that could be valuable in the generation of new antibiotics to combat the problem addressed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Analysis of the microstructure and phase composition showed that the ReN monolayer, which was the same as the coating used subsequently for the manufacture of the multilayers of TiAlN/ReN, possessed a cubic crystalline structure. The ReN coating had preferential columnar growth in the direction of the plane (111) and presented precipitates of the rhenium oxides ReO2 and ReO3. A detailed study of the electrochemical behavior and corrosion resistance of the coated steel substrate as a function of the number of TiAlN/ReN bilayers was carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization measurements. The coatings exhibited a relative high hardness and Young's Modulus, and a better performance against corrosion in aqueous media rich in chlorine ions when the bilayer number and period were 5 and 221.2 nm, respectively. It was observed that the formation of rhenium oxide particles influences the electrochemical behavior of coatings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The sample population corresponds to 30 people with an age between 22.86 +/-7.88 years. Participants developed Romberg test with a duration of 30 s and under the modalities eyes open and closed on a platform of plantar pressure and stabilometry BTS P-Walk. Significant changes were found in comparison of the open and closed eyes tests in the lateral flexion of the spine (LSF) with p=0.018, body center of gravity with p=0.043, left center of gravity with p=0.018, showing improvements in body stability evaluation with eyes closed. It is evident that skateboarding athletes due to the dynamics and sports development on an unstable base present a high level of stability represented in mediolateral and anteroposterior stability and variability radii close to zero, additionally it is observed that work at eye level closed generates a better sports adaptation from the vestibular and peripheral system for motor control and balance. © 2021 by authors, all rights reserved.},

Among those new applications, rehabilitation, and seismic retrofitting of existing damaged or non-ductile concrete structures can be highlighted. The main objective of this paper is to optimise the hybrid blend of fibres that allows a previously optimised eco-friendly ultra-high-performance cementitious paste to achieve the ductility requirements for seismic retrofitting applications at lower costs. To meet this goal, two artificial neural network models (ANNs) were created to predict the energy absorption capacity (g) and maximum post-cracking strain (εpc). A total of 50 own experimental campaign data added to 550 published works throughout the world data were used for training purposes by using the R-code language. Once the models were trained and validated, a multi-objective optimisation was used to select the combination of fibres that achieved the limit values of g ≥ 50 kJ/m3 and εpc ≥ 0.3% considering cost constraints. The experimentally validated results indicated that the adequate blend of high strength steel micro-fibres and hooked end normal strength steel fibres fulfil the threshold values at a lower cost. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {It is important to study metal powder obtained from industrial waste given that its incorporation in the productive cycle is key to the sustainability of the cities of the near future, as well as to the use of sustainable manufacturing techniques. In this paper, an iron/iron oxide powder obtained by reduction of mill scale from hot deformation of low carbon steel was processed by two different techniques: die pressing and metal fused filament fabrication. Considering that microstructural features and the chemical composition are important factors in the mechanical properties of the final pieces, these two aspects were studied, both in the powders and in the final pieces. It was found that the presence of the polymer matrix during sintering of the piece fabricated by metal fused filament plays a key role in the process. This is because the hydrocarbons and H2 produced during its decomposition lead to a further reduction in the remaining oxides, which in turn leads to an important difference with the pieces obtained by die pressing. Moreover, the dislocation density of the pieces is different, because the compaction of the powder by die pressing causes dislocation to multiply, while in the fused filament fabrication process there is no stage that involves dislocation multiplication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Functional tests aim to compare the functionality of a prosthesis with a human hand. The main objective of this work is to present and evaluate an affordable prosthesis (PrHand) built with soft robotic technologies and novel joints based on compliant mechanisms. Two functional tests have been selected in this work. The first is the AHAP protocol, which evaluates how the prosthesis performs eight different grips; three variables are considered: grasping, maintaining, and grasping ability score (GAS). The results were 69.03% with 57.77% in grasping and 80.28% in maintaining. The second test is the AM-ULA, which evaluates the prosthesis by performing 23 Activities of Daily Living. PrHand prosthesis had a score of 2.5 over 4.0. The functionality of the PrHand prosthesis has similar results to other prostheses evaluated in the literature. The comparison with the human hand was 69%. PrHand presents a promising solution for amputees in developing countries regarding cost and functionality.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Brain–computer interface (BCI) remains an emerging tool that seeks to improve the patient interaction with the therapeutic mechanisms and to generate neuroplasticity progressively through neuromotor abilities. Motor imagery (MI) analysis is the most used paradigm based on the motor cortex’s electrical activity to detect movement intention. It has been shown that motor imagery mental practice with movement-associated stimuli may offer an effective strategy to facilitate motor recovery in brain injury patients. In this sense, this study aims to present the BCI associated with visual and haptic stimuli to facilitate MI generation and control the T-FLEX ankle exoskeleton. To achieve this, five post-stroke patients (55–63 years) were subjected to three different strategies using T-FLEX: stationary therapy (ST) without motor imagination, motor imagination with visual stimulation (MIV), and motor imagination with visual-haptic inducement (MIVH). The quantitative characterization of both BCI stimuli strategies was made through the motor imagery accuracy rate, the electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis during the MI active periods, the statistical analysis, and a subjective patient’s perception. The preliminary results demonstrated the viability of the BCI-controlled ankle exoskeleton system with the beta rebound, in terms of patient’s performance during MI active periods and satisfaction outcomes. Accuracy differences employing haptic stimulus were detected with an average of 68% compared with the 50.7% over only visual stimulus. However, the power spectral density (PSD) did not present changes in prominent activation of the MI band but presented significant variations in terms of laterality. In this way, visual and haptic stimuli improved the subject’s MI accuracy but did not generate differential brain activity over the affected hemisphere. Hence, long-term sessions with a more extensive sample and a more robust algorithm should be carried out to evaluate the impact of the proposed system on neuronal and motor evolution after stroke. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the scientific community is creating global collaborative efforts to analyze these data. However, biomedical data is subject to several legal and socio-economic restrictions hindering the possibilities for research collaboration. In this paper, we argue that researchers require new tools and techniques to address the restrictions and needs of global scientific collaborations over geo-distributed biomedical data. These tools and techniques must support what we call Fully Distributed Collaborations (FDC), which are research endeavors that harness means to exploit and analyze massive biomedical information collaboratively while respecting legal and socio-economical restrictions. This paper first motivates and discusses the requirements of FDCs in the context of a research collaboration on the development of diagnostic and predictive tools for the risk of intracranial aneurysm formation and rupture (the ICAN project). The paper then presents a taxonomy classifying the current tools and techniques for biomedical analysis with respect to the proposed requirements. The taxonomy considers three key architectural features to support FDC scenarios: data and computation placement, Privacy and Security, and Performance and Scalability. The review reveals new research opportunities to design tools and techniques for multi-site analyses encouraging scientific collaborations while mitigating technical and legal constraints. © 2022},

T-FLEX is an ankle exoskeleton based on VSA for rehabilitation and assistance of people with ankle dysfunctions. This device has presented promising motor recovery results for a stroke patient during a rehabilitation program. However, human walking applications require an electromechanical characterization to measure the device's capabilities and determine the suitable configuration that responds to this complex task. This work presents T-FLEX's experimental characterization carried out in a test bench structure. The results showed alterations in system times and actuators’ bandwidth because of the tendons’ force levels. Furthermore, this study determined the most appropriate T-FLEX configuration to obtain the best performance. Thus, this work also presents a preliminary validation under that configuration on a healthy subject in gait assistance to assess the device's response in different velocities and measure the effects on the user. In conclusion, T-FLEX can assist the human gait for gait cycle duration greater than 0.74 s providing torque on the ankle of up to 12 Nm in propulsion and 20 Nm in dorsiflexion. Nevertheless, it should include an adaptable stage in the control architecture to counteract the stabilization time for providing the maximum torque at the right time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Physical models with varying layer depths reinforced with roots were performed in a geotechnical centrifuge. The soil reinforced with vegetation was simulated with a mixture of clay and fiberglass which present similar shear strength properties. Displacement vectors of the physical models are obtained using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The computed resultant displacements showed that the slip surface varied with respect the root depth. Additionally, numerical models of the tests in centrifuge were made using finite elements and Bishop's method. The results obtained also show that the deeper the roots, the deeper the sliding surface. The slip surface moves from a depth of the slope toe (slope without reinforcement) to a depth close to twice the height of the slope. Regarding the factor of safety, it varies from a value of 0.7 for slopes without vegetation to 1.19 for a root depth of three meters. Moreover, the factor of safety increases as root depth increases. © 2022, Iran University of Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {Walking is one of the most complex tasks a human being can perform. It takes several years to develop the patterns that enable a person to walk and run. Although it is now possible to replicate these patterns in machines such as robots, actuators are needed to control the pace and compensate for the energy loss of walking. However, in small robots (in the scale of centimeters) the size and weight of the actuators could be a limiting factor for their use. To solve this problem, quasi-passive walkers have been recently proposed. These walkers consist of several coupled rigid bodies, usually forming a biped, that move on flat surfaces in the presence of a gravitational field. It is well known that these bipeds can descend on small slope planes without the need for actuators. Walking on horizontal planes requires the presence of actuators to initiate and maintain the pace, however, these actuators could be small enough to "kick"the walker at the right point at the right time. In this work, we present a physical-mathematical model of a bipedal walker composed of five rigid bodies (two legs, two feet, and the hip) moving in a horizontal plane.

	abstract = {Wind power is one of the main sources of renewable energy. New applications of this technology are currently under development through small vertical axis wind turbines, allowing energy production in small spaces even at low wind speeds. Therefore, creating an effective turbine design methodology tailored to these operating conditions has been the subject of extensive research. The Savonius-type vertical axis wind turbine is one of the most widely used due to its low cost and easy manufacturing. Several works have examined the effect of various geometric parameters on the performance of the Savonius-type wind turbine. However, there are no published overarching conclusions about these works. Thus, this paper aims to review and discuss in a concise way experiments and simulations carried out by several authors evaluating the effect of some geometric parameters on the maximum power and torque coefficient of Savonius vertical axis wind turbines. The paper also discusses additional experiments that should be performed in future work. © 2022},

	abstract = {Physical exercise has become an essential tool for treating various non-communicable diseases (also known as chronic diseases). Due to this, physical exercise allows to counter different symptoms and reduce some risk of death factors without medication. A solution to support people in doing exercises is to use artificial systems that monitor their exercise progress. While one crucial aspect is to monitor the correct physical motions for rehabilitative exercise, another essential element is to give encouraging feedback during workouts. A coaching system can track a user’s exhaustion and give motivating feedback accordingly to boost exercise adherence. For this purpose, this research investigates whether it is possible to predict the subjective exhaustion level based on non-invasive and non-wearable technology. A novel data set was recorded with the facial record as the primary predictor and individual exhaustion levels as the predicted variable. 60 participants (30 male, 30 female) took part in the data recording. 17 facial action units (AU) were extracted as predictor variables for the perceived subjective exhaustion measured using the BORG scale. Using the predictor and the target variables, several regression and classification methods were evaluated aiming to predict exhaustion. The results showed that the decision tree and support vector methods provide reasonable prediction results. The limitation of the results, depending on participants being in the training data set and subjective variables (e.g., participants smiling during the exercises) were further discussed. © 2022 by the authors.},

This is used to establish some general conditions under which a random construction introduced by Katznelson for the integers yields sets that are dense in the Bohr group. We obtain in this way very sparse sets of real numbers (and of integers) on which two different almost periodic functions cannot agree, which makes them amenable to be used in sampling theorems for these functions. These sets can be made as sparse as to have zero asymptotic density or as to be t-sets, i.e., to be sets that intersect any of their translates in a bounded set. Many of these results are proved not only for almost periodic functions but also for classes of functions generated by more general complex exponential functions, including chirps or polynomial phase functions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Partial hand amputations are common in developing countries and have a negative impact on patients and their families’ quality of life. The uniqueness of each partial hand amputation, coupled with the relatively high costs of prostheses, makes it challenging to provide suitable prosthetic solutions in developing countries. Current solutions often have long lead times and require a high level of expertise to produce. The aim of this study was to design and develop an affordable patient-specific partial hand prosthesis for developing countries. Technique: The prosthesis was designed for a patient with transmetacarpal amputation (i.e. three amputated fingers and partial palm). The final design was passive, controlled by the contralateral hand, and utilized the advanced flexibility properties of thermoplastic polyurethane in a glove-like design that costs approximately 20 USD to fabricate. Quantitative and qualitative tests were conducted to assess performance of the device after the patient used the final design. A qualitative assessment was performed to gather the patient’s feedback following a series of tests of grasp taxonomy. A quantitative assessment was performed through a grasp and lift test to measure the prosthesis’ maximum load capacity. Discussion: This study showed that the prosthesis enhanced the patient’s manual handling capabilities, mainly in the form of grasp stability. The prosthesis was light weight and could be donned and doffed by the patient independently. Limitations include the need to use the contralateral hand to achieve grasping and low grasp strength. Clinical relevance: Persons with partial hand amputation in developing countries lack access to affordable functional prostheses, hindering their ability to participate in the community. 3D-printed prostheses can provide a low-cost solution that is adaptable to different amputation configurations. © The International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics 2020.},

For this reason, several efforts around the world have been made to develop UHPC with greener and less expensive local pozzolans. This study aimed to design and produce UHPC using local fly ash available in Colombia. A numerical optimization, based on Design of Experiments (DoE) and multi-objective criteria, was performed to obtain a mixture with the proper flow and highest compressive strength, while simultaneously having the minimum content of cement.

This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation. The ACE is designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies that constitute the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and calculate a set of 25 features that describes the suspect’s behavior. After 50 days of experiments, the chatbot generated a dataset with 7199 profiling vectors with the features associated to each suspect. Afterward, we applied an unsupervised method to describe the results that differentiate three groups, which we categorize as indifferent, interested, and pervert. Exhaustive analysis is conducted to validate the applicability and advantages of our solution. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Student engagement allows educational institutions to make better decisions regarding teaching methodologies, methods for evaluating the quality of education, and ways to provide timely feedback. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying cognitive student engagement in distance learning has been a challenge in higher education institutions. In this study, we implemented a non-self-report method assessing students’ heart rate data to identify the cognitive engagement during active learning activities. Additionally, as a supplementary tool, we applied a previously validated self-report method. This study was performed in distance learning lessons on a group of university students in Bogota, Colombia. After data analysis, we validated five hypotheses and compared the results from both methods. The results confirmed that the heart rate assessment had a statistically significant difference with respect to the baseline during active learning activities, and this variance could be positive or negative. In addition, the results show that if students are previously advised that they will have to develop an a new task after a passive learning activity (such as a video projection), their heart rate will tend to increase and consequently, their cognitive engagement will also increase. We expect this study to provide input for future research assessing student cognitive engagement using physiological parameters as a tool. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

A combination of properties is required, as biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, good mechanical strength and fracture toughness. In this research, a compound of alumina matrix with calcium titanate and calcium phosphate is proposed. Magnesium stearate was used as porogen agent. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of porosity on the crystalline phases formed, as well as the growing pattern and types of calcium phosphates formed after soaking in Hanks’ solution. It was found that the resultant porosity does affect the crystalline phases formed after sintering. It was also found that hydroxyapatite and octacalcium phosphate precipitates after soaking in Hank’s solution, and that the porosity affects the growing pattern. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

	abstract = {This research is based on the analysis of the effectiveness of the disinfection technologies used in ten (10) pools of the Piscilago Girardot - Cundinamarca Aquatic Park (chlorine, ozone, and UV radiation), through the physicochemical and microbiological characterization of the water. This analysis was carried out by means of two water samples per site, at different seasons (high and low), with the objective of comparing the characteristics of the water with a high and low flow of users [1]. Similarly, historical data was collected from the monthly monitoring of the park from August 2016 to December 2019. Among the main conclusions of the study, it stands out that all disinfection methods have 100% efficiency in terms of microbiological parameters such as total coliforms and E. Coli. However, due to its molecular stability, chlorine continues to disinfect even after applied, for which, to the ozone and UV radiation methods, a minimum dose of chlorine is applied to guarantee the residual effect. Likewise, it is evident that the efficiency of the water treatment in the swimming pools depends mainly on the operation of the system. If there is any excess or defect in the application of the disinfection method, this directly affects the non-compliance of the analyzed parameters contemplated in current regulations. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world. This is a disease in which cells in the breast grow and multiply out of control. Fortunately, it can be treated and cured if it is early detected. The most widely used screening method for this disease is mammography, which has a reporting standard, called 'Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System' (BIRADS), which classifies the lesions in categories numbered from 0 to 6. The aim of this research seeks to design and implement a computer-assisted diagnosis algorithm, in order to identify and classify breast lesions using image processing techniques, as a diagnostic aid for radiologists. For this purpose, five stages were done: Image pre-processing, image segmentation (including pectoral muscle and lesions in the area) by using region-growing technique, texture and morphological features extraction and classification of the lesions. To classify the lesions, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used, obtaining an 74.6% of accuracy, fulfilling the objective of exceeding the accuracy of a specialized observer. © 2021 IEEE.},

Frequently, they rely on surveillance cameras to identify the person's location and physical condition. However, this task requires a tedious continuous evaluation and demands the facilities' staff full attention. This task increases the attentional demand when working with patients with neurological conditions due to incremental risks related to sensory disturbances, cognitive and perceptual dysfunction, mobility, and communication disorders, visual, personality, and intellectual changes, and a complex range of speech and associated language disorders. In some cases, 24/7 monitoring is needed. The use of artificial intelligence shows a great performance for detecting objects and people by images or videos. This article aims at developing a methodology based on deep learning for the detection and monitoring of people in closed and open environments using video. The proposed method is non-invasive, low-cost, and evaluates a person's physical activity and inactivity in real-time. Preliminary results in public databases present outstanding results in the monitoring and estimation of caloric expenditure in indoor and outdoor environments. © 2021 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Cerebrovascular accidents (stroke) can cause neurological problems, transient or permanent disability, and even death. In cases where disability is present, it is useful to be able to obtain specific information about the damage caused to the brain. One way to quantify the specific characteristics of the damage caused by stroke is to perform a three-dimensional reconstruction. It is for this reason that this paper proposes a method to carry out this procedure. Initially, the process used is based on automatic segmentation of the lesion in each of the images or slices that are part of the brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequence. The segmented regions are used together for lesion volume reconstruction. This volume is displayed on an interface, along with its location within the skull, and its specific characteristics. The results obtained comprise an interface showing data of interest about the lesion and its reconstruction. Also, in the lesion segmentation process, a favorable Dice-Sorense coefficient index of 0.75 is obtained with respect to the images annotated by experts. The lesion characteristics estimated in the implemented interface, such as location and volume, have an error of less than 30% with respect to the annotations of the database used, showing that the information provided by the proposed method is quite useful for the specialist's understanding of the brain damage caused by the stroke. © 2021 IEEE.},

A specific area of the artificial intelligence is the natural language processing, however, most of these approaches are based on available data. This paper shows the construction of a dataset based on medical records of subjects suspected of tuberculosis. In addition, an initial exploration of the contents of the constructed dataset and how this approach can be followed by a natural language processing to support tuberculosis diagnosis in data demanding scenarios are presented.Clinical Relevance - In some developing countries as Colombia, it is difficult to develop systems based on artificial intelligence due to the availability of data. This proposal holds a strategy to build a dataset to train machine learning models, and to obtain support diagnosis tools, employing natural language from the medical scenario from text written by health professionals in the medical record. In this way, trained models based on this information available can be employed in places where medical infrastructure is precarious. © 2021 IEEE.},

UHPC is a high-tech type of concrete resulted of the mixture of several constituents. Therefore, the effect of each component and their interactions on compressive strength is more difficult to understand than in conventional concrete. A total of 210 own experimental campaign data added to 717 published work throughout the world data were used for training purposes by using the R-code language. To analyze the relationships between the UHPC's components and strength, the Olden algorithm was used. The interpretation of both the statistical performance metrics and the results of Olden's sensitivity analysis indicated that the proposed model was an efficient approach for predicting the compressive strength of UHPC.

	abstract = {What are the benefits of using a socially assistive robot for long-term cardiac rehabilitation? To answer this question we designed and conducted a real-world long-term study, in collaboration with medical specialists, at the Fundación Cardioinfantil-Instituto de Cardiología clinic (Bogotá, Colombia) lasting 2.5 years. The study took place within the context of the outpatient phase of patients' cardiac rehabilitation programme and aimed to compare the patients' progress and adherence in the conventional cardiac rehabilitation programme (control condition) against rehabilitation supported by a fully autonomous socially assistive robot which continuously monitored the patients during exercise to provide immediate feedback and motivation based on sensory measures (robot condition). The explicit aim of the social robot is to improve patient motivation and increase adherence to the programme to ensure a complete recovery. We recruited 15 patients per condition. The cardiac rehabilitation programme was designed to last 36 sessions (18 weeks) per patient. The findings suggest that robot increases adherence (by 13.3%) and leads to faster completion of the programme. In addition, the patients assisted by the robot had more rapid improvement in their recovery heart rate, better physical activity performance and a higher improvement in cardiovascular functioning, which indicate a successful cardiac rehabilitation programme performance. Moreover, the medical staff and the patients acknowledged that the robot improved the patient motivation and adherence to the programme, supporting its potential in addressing the major challenges in rehabilitation programmes. © Copyright © 2021 Céspedes, Irfan, Senft, Cifuentes, Gutierrez, Rincon-Roncancio, Belpaeme and Múnera.},

Four hug release methods in adults were applied, a short-time hug, a long-time hug, a touch-controlled hug, and a pressure-controlled hug. The social robot CASTOR was integrated into this study, a modification was made in its arms to perform the hugging action, and a pressure sensor in its upper back. 12 adults (5 females and 7 males) participated in the study. Results showed that the perception of friendliness comparing the short-time hug and the pressure-controlled hug had differences (p= 0.036 ), making the pressure-controlled hug more friendly. In the case of natural perception, the touch-controlled hug was more natural comparing with the short-time hug (p= 0.047 ). This study presents the feasibility of implementing CASTOR in hugging interactions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Since the policy of Sustainable Production and Consumption has laid the basis for the world to begin its transition towards a circular economy, engineering has a moral responsibility to recycle industrial byproducts. This is currently done with calamine, which is a mill scale resulting from high temperature steel manufacturing. Although calamine is used in different ways, it could be given greater added value by subjecting it to processing by powder metallurgy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to obtain powder from iron with a core of enriched magnetite iron oxide, and to evaluate the effect of this iron oxide nucleus on the hardness and magnetic properties of the material after sintering. It was found that iron oxide acts as a reinforcement for iron (the highest achieved hardness was 77.7 ± 1.2 HRB) due, in part, to the coherency between phases, and confers a ferrimagnetic behavior to it. Therefore, this material has potential for use in magnetic applications at higher frequencies than current soft materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays the use of natural fiber composites has gained significant interest due to their low density, high availability, and low cost. The present study explores the development of sustainable 3D printing filaments based on rice husk (RH), an agricultural residue, and recycled polypropylene (rPP) and the influence of fiber weight ratio on physical, thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of 3D printing parts. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the composite’s degradation process started earlier than for the neat rPP due to the lignocellulosic fiber components. Mechanical tests showed that tensile strength increased when using a raster angle of 0◦ than specimens printed at 90◦, due to the weaker inter-layer bonding compared to in-layer. Furthermore, inter layer bonding tensile strength was similar for all tested materials. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed the limited interaction between the untreated fiber and matrix, which led to reduced tensile properties. However, during the printing process, composites presented lower warping than printed neat rPP. Thus, 3D printable ecofriendly natural fiber composite filaments with low density and low cost can be developed and used for 3D printing applications, contributing to reduce the impact of plastic and agricultural waste. © 2021 by the authors.

These contracts allow students to work in real-life projects, in which a group of highly qualified academics confront theory and practice to generate solutions for the business sector, thus enriching traditional academic practices. The instrument used in this study consists of five dimensions: attitude towards KTT (knowledge and technology transfer) activities, expectation of contribution, promotion incentives, university culture and regulation, and supporting KTT services. The sample comprises 184 professors. The relevance of each factor related with the participation of researchers in R&D contracts (period 2010-2015) is identified through a structural equation model. The key findings emphasize the role played by culture and a favourable normative framework for KTT activities, while support services seem to negatively affect researchers' engagement in R&D contracts.

A way to reduce these consequences is to select an adequate level of PV generation in the distribution systems. PV Hosting Capacity (PVHC) is intended to achieve this goal by the determination of the maximum PV generation allowed in the system. This work presents a practical method to calculate the PVHC in a medium voltage feeder, analyzing the relationship between the load factor of the distribution transformer and the voltage, the current, and the active power when the PV solar penetration level changes. The results allowed to conclude that there is a direct relationship between PV solar penetration level and a load factor of the distribution transformers. © 2020 IEEE.},

Each sensing node contains a force sensitive resistor (FSR) and time-of-flight camera (TOF). Each FSR is placed inside the subject's shoe, while each TOF camera is located at the back of their foot. The FSR detects contact between heel and ground, and the TOF measures the distance to a barrier located on the right side of the walking path. Step width is calculated as the difference between the TOF measurements. After the walk is complete, the information obtained by the FSRs and TOFs is sent via a 433 MHz wireless communication to the concentrator board, which is connected to the USB port of a personal computer (PC).

Firstly, the user-centered features are divided into targeted goals focused on the applications and anatomic concepts. Within these features, the user features are described depending on their needs and requirements to perform a specific task. According to these user features, the device-centered features are delimited in terms of two principal groups: mechanical design and actuation and control. The mechanical design of a lower-limb exoskeleton is composed of the device's structure, joints, and physical interfaces, which comprise key elements and highlight important design considerations. Finally, the actuation and control displayed the classification of actuators and control strategies commonly used in lower-limb exoskeletons.

	abstract = {The knee flexion-extension angle is an important variable to be monitored in various clinical scenarios, for example, during physical rehabilitation assessment. The purpose of this work is to develop and validate a sensor fusion system based on a knee sleeve for monitoring of physical therapy. The system consists of merging data from two inertial measurement units (IMUs) and an intensity-variation based Polymer Optical Fiber (POF) curvature sensor using a quaternion-based Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF). The proposed data fusion method is magnetometer-free and deals with sensors' uncertainties through reliability intervals defined during gait. Walking trials were performed by twelve healthy participants using our knee sleeve system and results were validated against a gold standard motion capture system. Additionally, a comparison with other three knee angle estimation methods, which are exclusively based on IMUs, was carried out. The proposed system presented better performance (mean RMSE < 3.3circ, LFM coefficients, a_1 = 0.99 pm 0.04, a0 = 0.70 pm 2.29, R2 = 0.98 pm 0.01 and rhoC > 0.99) when compared to the other evaluated methods. Experimental results demonstrate the usability and feasibility of our system to estimate knee motion with high accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility. This wearable system may be suitable for motion assessment in rehabilitation labs in future studies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Linear and time-invariant dynamic systems (L.T.I.) of second order, called overdamped, are characterized because their poles are real and differents. Usually the step response has been proposed in terms of xi, w_{0}, and K_{DC} [1]-[3], which are called parameters of the transfer function, G(s); others have set it in terms of time constants tau_{1} and tau_{2} [4]-[6]. This article discusses the use of the dominant pole p1 and the relationship between the fastest pole and that one, alpha:=p2/p1, p1 < p2, to state the expression of the system response signal, y(t). This approach leads to a formulation of the expression for the simplest system output signal, setting xi and w_{0} in terms of p_{1} and alpha. It should be noted that this approach allows determining certain characteristics of the signal from output to input step, for example, the determination of the settling time t_{s}, rise time t_{r}, fitting it with a polynomial for an easy calculation, also the time in which the change of concavity occurs with which the output corresponding to that instant of time is determined, there it is shown that this value is not greater than 27% of K_{DC}. Finally, the general expression for the impulse response is presented, parameterized by p_{1}, K_{DC} and alpha. It is important to mention that the previous parameters cannot be obtained from the other known representations, with which from this work will have mathematical expressions to be able to completely analyze the overdamped second order systems, as the case for the first order systems, without having to simulate the output signal and obtain them from measurements on it.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The flow series for a future scenario were obtained for different climate change scenarios from a Global Climate Model (GCM) and the Coordinated Regional Experiment on Climate Reduction (CORDEX) by downscaling the results from the global scale to basin-scale using a statistical method based on chaos theory. These projections show that under conditions of climate change, the agricultural sector of the Balsillas basin will not suffer significant impacts since they will be able to satisfy most demand points. © (2020), (Universidad de Antioquia).

	abstract = {A Cyber-Physical System (CPS), as one of the most significant advances of information and communication technologies, is an interactive arrangement of digital and software elements engineered together for managing and controlling the functioning of physical elements. Even if this concept has been rapidly developed for manufacturing systems, there has been an increasing interest in recent years for developing and implementing it in a number of other domains: logistics, health, transport or education. Extensive research has shown that a straightforward application of CPS is in logistics or supply chain systems. However, research to date has not yet determined entirely the unambiguous characteristics of this technology within the logistic/supply chain domain. This paper provides an overview of cyber-physical systems applied to the logistics/supply domain. The approach of this paper is developed in three phases. First, it analyses and proposes a definition of cyber-physical logistics systems. Second, it explores the current literature approaches of cyber-physical logistics systems organized by the CPS maturity model. Third, it highlights the challenges and perspectives of cyber-physical logistics systems towards an industrial implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This is the reason that made local developments, both dosages and applications, of vital importance for UHPFRC wider use. That is why is important to emphasize the construction of the pedestrian bridge over Las Vegas Avenue in Medellin, the first infrastructure built in UHPC in Latin America, using a dosage with local materials developed by the company Argos SA. The new pedestrian bridge that connects the campus of the EAFIT University in Medellin with its language building is the first infrastructure work in Latin America in which UHPFRC was used. Initially the design included a metallic structure, however, Argos proposed to the University to change the steel for an UHPFRC dosage developed by Argos SA. The decision to opt for this material represented a saving of 34% in the total cost of the pedestrian bridge construction. © 2021, RILEM.},

	abstract = {The constant growth of pathologies affecting human mobility has led to developing of different assistive devices to provide physical and cognitive assistance. Smart walkers are a particular type of these devices since they integrate navigation systems, path-following algorithms, and user interaction modules to ensure natural and intuitive interaction. Although these functionalities are often implemented in rehabilitation scenarios, there is a need to actively involve the healthcare professionals in the interaction loop while guaranteeing safety for them and patients. This work presents the validation of two visual feedback strategies for the teleoperation of a simulated robotic walker during an assisted navigation task. For this purpose, a group of 14 clinicians from the rehabilitation area formed the validation group. A simple path-following task was proposed, and the feedback strategies were assessed through the kinematic estimation error (KTE) and a usability survey. A KTE of 0.28 m was obtained for the feedback strategy on the joystick. Additionally, significant differences were found through a Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test for the perception of behavior and confidence towards the joystick according to the modes of interaction (p-values of 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). The use of visual feedback with this tool contributes to research areas such as remote management of therapies and monitoring rehabilitation of people’s mobility. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Modular hip joint implants were introduced in arthroplasty medical procedures because they facilitate the tailoring of patients’ anatomy, the use of different materials in one single con-figuration, as well as medical revision. However, in certain cases, such prostheses may undergo deterioration at the head–neck junctions with negative clinical consequences. Crevice-corrosion is commonly invoked as one of the degradation mechanisms acting at those junctions despite biomedi-cal alloys such as Ti6Al4V and CoCr being considered generally resistant to this form of corrosion. To verify the occurrence of crevice corrosion in modular hip joint junctions, laboratory crevice-corrosion tests were conducted in this work under hip joint-relevant conditions, i.e., using similar convergent crevice geometries, materials (Ti6Al4V and CoCr alloys vs. ceramic), surface finish, NaCl solution pHs (5.6 and 2.3), and electrochemical conditions. A theoretical model was also developed to describe crevice-corrosion considering relevant geometrical and electrochemical parameters. To verify the model, a FeCr alloy, known to be sensitive to this phenomenon, was subjected to the crevice-corrosion test in sulfuric acid. The experiments and the model predictions clearly showed that, in principle, crevice corrosion of Ti6Al4V or CoCr is not supposed to occur in typical crevices formed at the stem-neck junction of hip implants. © 2021 by the authors.

Sensors such as laser rangefinders, force platforms and motion tracking systems have been widely used to achieve legs' position tracking, as well as to estimate gait spatio-temporal parameters. However, the validation of those measurements with a gold standard system is still lacking. In this sense, this work is aimed at proposing an online system for the estimation of gait parameters for walker-assisted gait with smart or robotic devices. Moreover, a validation study with an optoelectronic system was carried out. A group of 30 healthy volunteers was recruited. The trials were performed on a treadmill, where the subjects were asked to walk at 4 different speeds. The proposed system is equipped with a laser rangefinder to calculate the users' legs position. Additionally, two adaptive filters, as well as a linear mathematical model were used to adjust the estimations of the users' gait parameters. Results show that our proposed system is able to estimate the stride cadence and the step length with an error lower than 5% compared with the gold standard system. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

This study carried out a longitudinal experimental setup with a total of 209 sessions observed for a group of 6 patients in a period between 3 and 6 months. Results show that patients felt more encouraged to perform physical activity and continue with the rehabilitation when they perceived that monitored and supervised by the system, demonstrating that it can be implemented as a reliable tool that would potentially leverage tasks carried out by health professionals. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Scheduling is a crucial activity for the successful control and piloting of manufacturing activities. Manufacturing systems operate in dynamic environments vulnerable to real-time events, which frequently force a reactive revision of pre-established schedules. In an uncertain environment, it has become preferable to adapt the scheduling from pre-established schedules as the latter may become vastly degraded at unexpected events. For this, a reactive module is often included to update the scheduling in order to assure manufacturing execution. However, due to the need of rapid response, this updating might be executed experiencing myopia and/or nervousness issues. This paper aims to develop a proof of concept of a decision support system for practitioners, attempting to minimize the degradation and lack of information during these scenarios. This approach starts with a metaheuristic technique to generate a predictive schedule for establishing an initial scheduling, named pre-established schedule. Then, during disruptions, it executes a scheduling updating through a reactive module based on a heuristic technique. The proposed approach was tested in a simulated scenario of a real flexible manufacturing system located in Valenciennes (France), called AIP-PRIMECA Valenciennes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The lack of public charging infrastructure has been one of the main barriers preventing the technological transition from traditional vehicles to electric vehicles. To accelerate this technological transition, it is necessary to elaborate optimal charging station location strategies to increase the user confidence, and maintain investment costs within acceptable levels. However, the existing works for this purpose are often based on multipath considerations or multi-objective functions, that result in taxing computational efforts for urban transportation networks. This article presents a heuristic methodology for urban transportation networks, that considers the deployment of the charging stations for coverage purposes, and the fulfilment of user preferences and constraints as two separated processes. In this methodology, a Reallocation Algorithm is formulated to prioritize the selection of Locations of Interest, and to reduce the number of stations with overlapping covering areas. The methodology results are compared to those drawn from a Greedy Algorithm based on a multipath consideration, in an extensive metropolitan transportation network. The results show that the proposed methodology significantly reduce the computational time required for solving the location problem, and furthermore, allows for similar results to those obtained when considering k = 2 and k = 3 deviation paths. © 2021 The Authors.

In both models the asymmetries of information regarding the existence of the asset price bubbles induce rational traders to perpetuate the bubbles. In our experiment we found that human traders are, most of the time, risk averse, they suffer impatience and do not necessarily react appropriately to coordination messages (even though the presence of said messages affects their behavior) and sometimes they clearly behave irrationally. Last but not least, during the experiment we also found that the human traders could adapt their strategies to optimal equilibrium strategies, so long as these strategies were not too complex - but not all human traders have the same ability to execute this adaptation process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation has been shown to effectively improve the sequelae and restore function for neurological patients. However, repetitive exercise in long-term therapy may cause a lack of interest and demotivation decreasing the therapy success. Serious games in the rehabilitation field have emerged as a promising approach by including an entertainment component during cognitive and motor skill learning. These interactive strategies improve the user-device interaction generating an active commitment during the therapy and contributing to the neuroplasticity induction. Well-designed game mechanics and audiovisual feedback strategies are relevant to provide a pleasant experience and augment patient engagement and adherence. In this sense, this chapter defines serious games and describes the design principles for their implementation in assistance therapy. Besides, it provides evidence about in-game strategies in lower-limb rehabilitation and introduces a serious game prototype for ankle rehabilitation after stroke with a variable stiffness exoskeleton. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

	abstract = {The constant modification of land use, economic instability, environmental factors, and social behaviour changes among the inhabitants of big cities characterize current urbanism. In Colombia, land‐use planning processes supported by geographical information systems are a recent phenomenon and the legal instruments of spatial planning are inadequate in most municipalities. Moreover, socio‐spatial equity represents a challenge for Latin American cities in which there is increasing awareness of the role that spatial planning plays. Consequently, the question arises as to how the urban spatial structure and organization contribute to an inclusive and equitable socio‐spatial evolution, considering climate change impacts. The case study analysed in this article focuses upon the northern limits of the city of Bogotá. Therefore, this research aims to define the ideal balance of urban land‐use distribution between social stratum classification and the vulnerability of the communities seeking to better adapt to climate change. We propose a methodological approach of analysing spatial syntax and the (social) intensity of activities and infrastructure, which enables us to characterize the urban structure itself and identify vulnerable urban instances. As a result, we find that the urban network with low values presents spatial unpredictability in its pattern, constraining equitable development based on the urban morphology of the city. This research allows us to conclude that the degree of vulnerability encountered by the social urban spatial structure is higher in expansion areas than in central areas of the city. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

This article presents the study of a battery charging system for electric vehicles based on the constant movement of the traction system. Method: An evaluation is carried out on a constant kinetic energy regeneration system to increase the autonomy of electric vehicles. This is achieved through the validation of a mathematical energy consumption model of a battery-based electric vehicle with a regenerative brake system, comparing the results of consumption and load states between the two energy recovery systems by means of simulations. Results: The vehicle with constant motion regeneration system consumed 42,9 % more power than the one using a regenerative brake because the new system increased the total mass in the vehicle. This increase in mass means that more power must be consumed by the traction system to move the vehicle. Conclusions: The conventional regenerative brake system is more favorable with respect to the proposed regeneration system for kinetic energy, except in constant speed and zero acceleration sections. © The authors; reproduction right holder Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.},

	abstract = {To design a control system it is necessary having it's most accurate mathematical model as posible, so that the results of its implementation be as expected. In the case of second order systems of the underdamped type, from the overshoot and the peak time, two of its three parameters can be determined, its angular frequency and its damping ratio if it is less than 0.8, from mathematical expressions that relate them. For second-order systems with a damping ratio greater than one, called overdamped, there are no mathematical expressions that allow the determination of their parameters, so graphic methods are used, the results of which depend on the precision with which the reading is made. Several methods have been proposed to determine their system parameters, some of them use the response curve to step function and based on the information of some points of the curve and with the help of graphics and standardized curves, the parameters are determined. Other methods make use of identification techniques such as minimum squares, or through genetic algorithms. This paper discusses how to determine the transfer function parameters for a second order overdamped system, zeta, omega_{o} and K_{DC}, but unlike other approaches based on the aforementioned parameters, the problem is expressed in terms of p_{1}, alpha and K_{DC}, with p_{1} being the dominant pole, alpha the ratio between p_{1} and p_{2}, the fastest pole (p_{2}/p_{1}=alpha) and K_{DC}. It is shown that proposing the response to the step in terms of p_{1} and alpha allows consider an approximation to the response and thus a way to estimate p_{1} and alpha from two points in the reaction curve. The choice of these two points is very important for the success of the method. The algorithm for estimating and parameters is shown, in an analytical way, by using two points in the reaction curve and without the use of graphics as indicated by. Some examples are made to show the application of the method and to compare its results with other methods that have been proposed and that are references in the specialized literature. It is shown that for overdamped systems the proposed method has the best results with respect to the other methods considered. The results of the proposed method are also compared against those obtained by other methods for higher order systems indicated in one of the references. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the criterion of square of the error's integral is used so that its advantage can be observed.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robotic devices can provide physical assistance to people who have suffered neurological impairments such as stroke. Neurological disorders related to this condition induce abnormal gait patterns, which impede the independence to execute different Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). From the fundamental role of the ankle in walking, Powered Ankle-Foot Orthoses (PAFOs) have been developed to enhance the users’ gait patterns, and hence their quality of life. Ten patients who suffered a stroke used the actuation system of the T-FLEX exoskeleton triggered by an inertial sensor on the foot tip. The VICONmotion capture system recorded the users’ kinematics for unassisted and assisted gait modalities. Biomechanical analysis and usability assessment measured the performance of the system actuation for the participants in overground walking. The biomechanical assessment exhibited changes in the lower joints’ range of motion for 70% of the subjects. Moreover, the ankle kinematics showed a correlation with the variation of other movements analyzed. This variation had positive effects on 70% of the participants in at least one joint. The Gait Deviation Index (GDI) presented significant changes for 30% of the paretic limbs and 40% of the non-paretic, where the tendency was to decrease. The spatiotemporal parameters did not show significant variations between modalities, although users’ cadence had a decrease of 70% of the volunteers. Lastly, the satisfaction with the device was positive, the comfort being the most user-selected aspect. This article presents the assessment of the T-FLEX actuation system in people who suffered a stroke. Biomechanical results show improvement in the ankle kinematics and variations in the other joints. In general terms, GDI does not exhibit significant increases, and the Movement Analysis Profile (MAP) registers alterations for the assisted gait with the device. Future works should focus on assessing the full T-FLEX orthosis in a larger sample of patients, including a stage of training. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Robotic devices applied to a rehabilitation context require a deeper understanding of their actuators to delimit the device's capabilities, improve the control strategies, and enhance the human-robot interaction. This way, experimental characterizations have allowed estimating these aspects, either employing test bench structures or involving the user during the process. In terms of pneumatic actuators, the goal of the experimental characterization is to find the required pressure that generates the full bending and the bending and blocked forces. On the other hand, for variable stiffness actuators, the goal is to measure the system response and the interaction forces concerning the variation in the device setup. In this context, this chapter presents the experimental characterization of two actuators aimed at assistive applications: (1) a variable stiffness ankle exoskeleton and (2) a pneumatic hand exoskeleton. Thus, different test bench structures were developed to integrate the device's concepts, measure the device's capabilities, and determine the system responses. Finally, some devices based on soft actuators applied to clinical scenarios are also presented in this chapter. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 202.

	abstract = {The introduction of modular design in total hip arthroplasty has enabled the use of different materials in one single configuration and the adjustment of the prosthesis to the patient's body, and facilitated medical revisions. However, modularity leads to the presence of new interfaces created between pieces in contact, raising the issue of degradation. Tribocorrosion phenomena have been identified as the main degradation mechanism due to the mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical conditions acting on the materials. In addition, conditions inside the human body are unclear, regarding electrochemical settings and the interaction between the electrochemical and mechanical action. This work is focused on the degradation of monopolar hip joint implants made from biomedical alloys such as stainless steel, Ti, and CoCr alloys. Three cases are presented and analyzed in terms of the degradation level along the trunnion length. Surface analysis done on a titanium trunnion showed a significant ploughing on the distal part, compared to what was found for stainless steel and cobalt-chromium alloys, which can produce a stuck in this area. Meanwhile, in the proximal part, wear debris is found, which suggests more movement in the internal part. Although few debris particles were identified in CoCr trunnion, a large amount of material inside the contact was observed. This could be related to the ploughing generated in the distal thread pattern, which allowed the material to come inside and outside the contact. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The stigmatization of natural sciences and mathematics as difficult, boring and non-practical subjects, starting at the secondary levels, has caused an increased disarticulation between the significant learning of physics and the student, this can be reflected in a less development of basic competences, an almost instinctive revulsion of a large number of students towards these subjects and poor results in the tests that are carried out. Reflecting on this situation, we apply the inquiry-based science education. The intervention was carried out in a private calendar B school in the town of Chía, Colombia; Latitude: 4.85, Longitude:-74.05 4 51' 0?. The participants were 80 students, the instruments used to collect the information were: class observations, surveys, interviews, an entrance, an exit test and another after the exit test. Two specific inquiry based-science type activities were designed: laboratory practices and the manufacture of a device by the student. These two activities in turn had matrices with defined evaluation criteria to evaluate the impact of the intervention. The students found in the investigation, a much more conducive environment for their learning and in the end the proposal allowed to identify positive impacts of the inquiry based-science as well as not so desired results.  © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Stroke is the main neurological condition causing disability worldwide. Physical therapy and robotic devices have been used in rehabilitation to recover lost locomotor functions. Despite the advantages of using robots in rehabilitation scenarios, some joints remain with alterations after therapy processes (e.g., the ankle joint). This paper presents a single case study of a patient with chronic stroke who participated in 18 sessions to assess the effects of T-FLEX in lower limb kinematics, spatiotemporal parameters, and muscular activity. To this end, each session consisted of two modalities: (1) 90-degree knee flexion, and (2) complete knee extension. The results showed improvement in the participant's spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters, as well as in the foot clearance during the swing phase. Regarding the muscular activity, the first sessions showed considerable increases related to the patient's inactivity. However, as the experiment proceeded, this value decreased as a consequence of the adaptation to the device. Regarding the electrical activity measured during each session, both muscles (i.e., gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior) tended to increase at the end-stage.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: This paper presents the design and development of an electronic device that operates as a satellite backup channel for automatic vehicle location (AVL) equipment, whose only communication channel is the cellular network. Method: The design, manufacture and assembly of the hardware followed 4 phases, and it was aligned with the IPC 2221 standard. This allowed improving the design experience and guaranteed the correct electrical operation in the final product. Results: The information sent by the developed device corresponds to the data generated by the AVL device, which indicates that the information processing was correctly designed. Additionally, it was possible to obtain a functional and versatile device in which the blocks were correctly integrated; its firmware was designed to receive future updates that improved and expanded its capacity and compatibility with other devices. Conclusions: The final product, which works with the Iridium network, seeks to satisfy the technological requirements of the freight transport sector in Colombia with a low-cost, versatile, and easily integrated solution. The implementation of this type of technologies expands the capacity of tracking mobile assets, even in places where there is no cellular network coverage. © The authors; reproduction right holder Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.},

These chips are small and semi continuous, so they are not suitable for recycling by melting. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to study the recyclability through powder metallurgy techniques of aluminum chips left over from sawing processes, studying the influence of grinding time on the properties of both the aluminum powder and the sintered materials. Grinding was performed in ball mill using a rotational speed of 55 rpm at different grinding times. The cold compaction process was performed applying 800 MPa of pressure. The cylindrical samples were sintered using argon as the inert gas at a temperature of 620 °C for 1 h. We conclude that aluminum chips from the sawing process are suitable for recycling through powder metallurgy techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Social Assistive Robotics could be a potential tool to support clinical care areas, promoting physical distancing, and reducing the contagion rate. In this context, this paper presents a long-term evaluation of a social robotic platform for gait neurorehabilitation. The robot's primary roles are monitoring physiological progress and promoting social interaction with human distancing during the sessions. A clinical validation with ten patients during 15 sessions were conducted in a rehabilitation center located in Colombia. Results showed that the robot's support improves the patients' physiological progress by reducing their unhealthy spinal posture time, with positive acceptance. 65% of patients described the platform as helpful and secure. Regarding the robot's role within the therapy, the health care staff agreed (>95%) that this tool can promote physical distancing and it is highly useful to support neurorehabilitation throughout the pandemic. These outcomes suggest the benefits of this tool to be further implemented in the pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Céspedes, Raigoso, Múnera and Cifuentes.},

A multi-objective algorithm was executed to reach an eco-friendly mixture with the proper flow, the highest compressive strength, while simultaneously having the minimum content of cement. The experimental verification of this mathematical optimization demonstrated that the use of 621 kg/m3 of ASTM Type HE cement, with a maximum content of 100 kg/m3 of silica fume, should be considered the most appropriate amount to be employed in the RCP mixture to achieve a value of compressive strength over 150 MPa and a self-compacting mixture. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

This paper presents the results obtained from hydrological modeling exercises in the Gualí River Basin (Colombia) by combining the Hydro-BID modeling tool, which consists of an analytical hydrology database for Latin America and the Caribbean that provides a great advantage for countries with limited information and the Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) modeling tool, in order to determine the potential impacts of climate change on unsatisfied demand for water in the basin. The results show a possible decrease in flow compared to current conditions; between 5.8% and 9.56% for CPR 2.6, and between 2.18% and 6.86% for CPR 8.5. The approach presented is useful to ensure that timely decisions are made to meet the demands of users under the conditions of climate change. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Despite the increment of researches related to Social Assistive Robotics (SAR), achieving a plausible Robot-Assisted Diagnosis (RAD) for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (CwASD) remains a considerable challenge to the clinical and robotics community. The work of specialists regarding ASD diagnosis is hard and labor-intensive due to the condition's manifestations are inherently heterogeneous and makes the process more difficult. Besides, the aforementioned complexity may be the main reason for the slow progress in the development of SAR with diagnostic purposes. Thus, this work provides a comprehensive Robot-Assisted Intervention for CwASD showing the conditions in which a Robot-based approach can be useful to assess autism risk factors for an autism diagnosis purpose. The intervention scheme consists of an improved version of a multimodal environment for Robot-based intervention proposed in our previous work. More specifically, we compared the behavior of CwASD with that of children in a control group during a human/robot-mediated intervention while Joint Attention (JA) behaviors are elicited and analyzed. Through statistical data analysis, it was possible to identify that 17 out of 23 children of the CwASD group showed a different behavior pattern related to three characteristics of autism, which suggests that this pattern can be used to identify autism risk factors through Robot-based interventions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

We first investigate the mainstream theory of SSC and their corresponding measurement frameworks. From the analysis, we show that such frameworks do not address the dynamic behaviour of cities. We then explore knowledge based smart sustainable cities, as an alternative theory of SSC, and investigate the measurement frameworks derived from this theory. We show that, despite having a different approach, these measurement frameworks still depend on static indicators and promote static view of the city. We then conjecture that this is due to fussy definitions of knowledge and incomplete investigations of the implications of latest theories of knowledge over the structure and strategy of smart cities. Finally, we propose a set of premises and principles that will improve the theory of Knowledge based smart sustainable cities (KBSSC) and show how this new definition will affect the design of indicators and measurement frameworks in a KBSSC. © 2020 ACM.},

Lokomat is one of the most used devices for gait rehabilitation. This device allows therapists to focus on the patient and the therapy. However, this therapy session is based on multi-tasking processes, which are often difficult for a therapist to manage. In this work, a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR) was integrated into a neurorehabilitation program as a collaborator agent to promote patient engagement and performance during the therapy. This short-term study presents the effects comparing the social robot condition and control condition with a group of four neurological patients using repeated measurement design. As a remarkable result, patients improved thoracic 18.44% and cervical 32.23% posture on average with SAR assistance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the integration of a social robot as a complement of gait rehabilitation programs. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Defining relationships between running mechanisms and fatigue can be a major asset for optimising training. This article proposes a biomechanical model of time to exhaustion according to indicators derived from accelerometry data collected from the body. Ten volunteers were recruited for this study. The participants were equipped with 3 accelerometers: on the right foot, at the tibia and at the L4-L5 lumbar spine. A running test was performed on a treadmill at 13.5 km/h until exhaustion. Thirty-one variables were deployed during the test. Multiple linear regressions were calculated to explain the time to exhaustion from the indicators calculated on the lumbar, tibia and foot individually and simultaneously. Time to exhaustion was predicted for simultaneous measurement points with (Formula presented.) and 21 indicators; for the lumbar with (Formula presented.) and 11 indicators; for the tibia with (Formula presented.) and 11 indicators; and for the foot with (Formula presented.) and 12 indicators. This study allows the accurate modelling of the time to exhaustion during a running-based test using indicators from accelerometer measurements. The individual models highlight that the location of the measurement point is important and that each location provides different information. Future studies should focus on homogeneous populations to improve predictions and errors. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Comparison for feature extraction and the employed detection models were analyzed to find the best election in an application for close-open fist in hands for two scenarios, according to two or three classes classification. The results achieved more than 90% in accuracy for both domain approaches in the two classes case. For the three classes detection, the results dropped out to 87% in accuracy.

At the same time, organizations working on Systems of Systems have been developing solutions for closing this gap for many years now. This work aims to extract such knowledge from practitioners by studying the case of a large-scale scientific instrument, a geographically distributed radio telescope to be more specific, developed as a sequence of projects during the last two decades. As the means for collecting data for this study we combine online interviews with a virtual focus group of practitioners from the organization responsible for building the instrument. Through this process, we identify persisting problems and the best practices that have been developed to deal with them, together with the perceived benefits and drawbacks of applying the latter in practice. Some of our major findings include the need to avoid over-reliance on the flexibility of software to compensate for incomplete requirements, hidden assumptions, as well as late involvement of system architecting, and to facilitate the cooperation between the involved disciplines through dedicated architecting roles and the adoption of unifying practices and standards. © 2021 IEEE.},

An ecofriendly ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) with a low carbon footprint was developed, aiming for a compressive strength of 150 MPa (22 ksi) and a high packing density (0.81) while using recycled glass powder and micro-limestone powder as partial substitution of silica fume and ordinary portland cement. Besides the commercially available normal-strength deformed steel fibers, high-strength smooth steel fibers were used to establish a comparison. The study showed that, with appropriate hooked normal-strength and smooth high-strength steel fibers, 1% of fiber is enough to achieve strain hardening behavior. Moreover, the smooth fibers achieved the maximum tensile strength (σpc = 11.04 MPa) when 2% of volume was used. However, despite having less tensile strength, only the hooked-end fibers achieved a maximum post-cracking strain (εpc) of over 0.3% using 2% of volume. © 2021 American Concrete Institute.

	abstract = {Due to the health emergency currently affecting the planet, it has been impossible for engineering specialists to carry out direct inspections of the land. During this time, it has been necessary to develop techniques and procedures that allow engineers to obtain information from the land remotely. Here, they are supported by the technology that allows them to record images remotely via drones and communicate so they can perform inspections by auxiliary field personnel, directed at a distance by specialists. To do this, a preliminary flight plan is defined, based on the experience and knowledge of the terrain by the specialist and the visual of the drone is transmitted via the Internet from a PC in the field. Later, which images to record and the sites that require more detail or a direct inspection by the field assistant are defined. Finally, the field assistant transmits the images of the inspection. In this way, the specialist's training and experience, the operational ease of the drone, and the skill of the field staff are taken advantage of. This article details the procedure for remote inspection, and ways in which it can even be extended to corridor recognition tasks to define the layout of rights of way. Copyright © 2021 by ASME.},

This paper aims to optimize a UHPFRC to meet ductility needs for seismic retrofitting applications at a lower cost. To achieve this objective, two Random Forest models were created to estimate the energy absorption capacity and the maximum post-cracking strain. Even though random forest models have been reported as one of the most efficient approaches for forecasting the properties of special concretes, with the purpose of demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed methodology, the random-forest-based optimization results were assessed by experimental works. The experimentally validated results showed that the appropriate combination of high-strength steel microfibers and normal-strength steel fibers with hooked ends meet the limit values (g ≥ 50 kJ/m3 and εpc ≥ 0.3%) at a lower cost. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Natural filler-based composites are an environmentally friendly and potentially sustainable alternative to synthetic or plastic counterparts. Recycling polymers and using agro-industrial wastes are measures that help to achieve a circular economy. Thus, this work presents the development and characterization of a 3D printing filament based on recycled polypropylene and cocoa bean shells, which has not been explored yet. The obtained composites were thermally and physically charac-terized. In addition, the warping effect, mechanical, and morphological analyses were performed on 3D printed specimens. Thermal analysis exhibited decreased thermal stability when cacao bean shell (CBS) particles were added due to their lignocellulosic content. A reduction in both melting enthalpy and crystallinity percentage was identified. This is caused by the increase in the amorphous structures present in the hemicellulose and lignin of the CBS. Mechanical tests showed high depen-dence of the mechanical properties on the 3D printing raster angle. Tensile strength increased when a raster angle of 0◦ was used, compared to specimens printed at 90◦, due to the load direction. Tensile strength and fracture strain were improved with CBS addition in specimens printed at 90◦, and better bonding between adjacent layers was achieved. Electron microscope images identified particle frac-ture, filler-matrix debonding, and matrix breakage as the central failure mechanisms. These failure mechanisms are attributed to the poor interfacial bonding between the CBS particles and the matrix, which reduced the tensile properties of specimens printed at 0◦ . On the other hand, the printing process showed that cocoa bean shell particles reduced by 67% the characteristic warping effect of recycled polypropylene during 3D printing, which is advantageous for 3D printing applications of the rPP. Thereby, potential sustainable natural filler composite filaments for 3D printing applications with low density and low cost can be developed, adding value to agro-industrial and plastic wastes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Physical exercise (PE) has become an essential tool for different rehabilitation programs. High-intensity exercises (HIEs) have been demonstrated to provide better results in general health conditions, compared with low and moderate-intensity exercises. In this context, monitoring of a patients’ condition is essential to avoid extreme fatigue conditions, which may cause physical and physiological complications. Different methods have been proposed for fatigue estimation, such as: monitoring the subject’s physiological parameters and subjective scales. However, there is still a need for practical procedures that provide an objective estimation, especially for HIEs. In this work, considering that the sit-to-stand (STS) exercise is one of the most implemented in physical rehabilitation, a computational model for estimating fatigue during this exercise is proposed. A study with 60 healthy volunteers was carried out to obtain a data set to develop and evaluate the proposed model. According to the literature, this model estimates three fatigue conditions (low, moderate, and high) by monitoring 32 STS kinematic features and the heart rate from a set of ambulatory sensors (Kinect and Zephyr sensors). Results show that a random forest model composed of 60 sub-classifiers presented an accuracy of 82.5% in the classification task. Moreover, results suggest that the movement of the upper body part is the most relevant feature for fatigue estimation. Movements of the lower body and the heart rate also contribute to essential information for identifying the fatigue condition. This work presents a promising tool for physical rehabilitation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this sense, IoT devices have become an essential component of smart cities, allowing many novel and useful services, but, at the same time, bringing numerous cybersecurity threats. The paper at hand proposes BlockSIEM, a blockchain-based and distributed Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution framework for the protection of the aforementioned smart city services. The proposed SIEM relies on blockchain technology to securely store and access security events. Such security events are generated by IoT sentinels that are in charge of shielding groups of IoT devices. The IoT sentinels may be deployed in smart city scenarios, such as smart hospitals, smart transport systems, smart airports, among others, ensuring a satisfactory level of protection. The blockchain guarantees the non-repudiation and traceability of the registry of security events due to its features. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, our proposal is implemented using Ethereum and validated through different use cases and experiments. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Context: The evaluation of air quality in Colombia is localized; it does not go beyond determining whether the level of the polluting gas at a specific point of the monitoring network has exceeded a threshold, according to a norm or standard, in order to trigger an alarm. It is not committed to objectives as important as the real-time identification of the dispersion dynamics of polluting gases in an area, or the prediction of the newly affected population. From this perspective, the presence of polluting gases was evaluated on the university campus of Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito, located north of the city of Bogotá, and the affected population was estimated for the month of October, 2019, using the Kriging geostatistical technique. Method: This study is part of the design and construction of an auxiliary mobile station that monitors and reports complementary information (CO and SO2 gases) to that provided by the Guaymaral meteo-rological station, located in the north of Bogotá. This information is transmitted through an IoT network to a server, where a database is created which stores the information on polluting gases reported by the 14 stations of the Bogotá air quality monitoring network, the information sent by the auxiliary station, and the statistical information of the population present on the university campus. Pollutant gas data and population information recorded from October 1st to 31st, 2019, are the input for data analysis using the Kriging interpolation method and predicting the affected population on said campus. Results: There is a particulate matter concentration of 29 µg/m3 of PM10 in the coliseum and 12,6 µg/m3 of PM2,5 in building G, in addition to 9,8 ppb of O3 in building I, 14,9 ppb of NO2 in that same building, 0,79 ppb of CO in building C, and 0,65 ppb of SO2 also in building C, thus allowing to infer, according to the Bogotá air quality index, a favorable air quality for a population of 2.131 people who visited the campus university during the aforementioned period. Conclusions: The correct integration of the data in the web server and their analysis, carried out in the R language, allowed determining the approximate indicators of the polluting factors around Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito. Additionally, to determine the affected population, these indicators were correlated with the information on the registered population that entered the campus during the period under study. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that the air quality on the campus of Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería Julio Garavito is favorable, and that 2.131 people benefited daily from these conditions. © 2021, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas.

	abstract = {Several challenges to guarantee medical care have been exposed during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although the literature has shown some robotics applications to overcome the potential hazards and risks in hospital environments, the implementation of those developments is limited, and few studies measure the perception and the acceptance of clinicians. This work presents the design and implementation of several perception questionnaires to assess healthcare provider's level of acceptance and education toward robotics for COVID-19 control in clinic scenarios. Specifically, 41 healthcare professionals satisfactorily accomplished the surveys, exhibiting a low level of knowledge about robotics applications in this scenario. Likewise, the surveys revealed that the fear of being replaced by robots remains in the medical community. In the Colombian context, 82.9% of participants indicated a positive perception concerning the development and implementation of robotics in clinic environments. Finally, in general terms, the participants exhibited a positive attitude toward using robots and recommended them to be used in the current panorama. © Copyright © 2021 Sierra Marín, Gomez-Vargas, Céspedes, Múnera, Roberti, Barria, Ramamoorthy, Becker, Carelli and Cifuentes.},

Despite the attractive combination of properties of electroless coatings, studies in the tribocorrosion field, such as fretting-corrosion behavior of Ni-P electroless coatings, are very scarce. In this work, Ni–P-TiO2 composite electroless coatings with several variations on particles size and content applied on AZ91D magnesium alloys were analyzed under fretting-corrosion conditions in 3.5 wt.% NaCl. Coatings were obtained by direct electroless technique in multiple steps. Procedures were chromium-free and no activation pretreatment was needed. The tests were carried out using a fretting-corrosion tribometer from where open circuit potential and coefficient of friction were analyzed, as well as wear tracks on coatings surfaces were observed by SEM. The results obtained indicate that an improvement in the tribochemical behavior of Ni-P coatings can be achieved with the TiO2 codeposit, which modify the contact between body and counter body, the elastic accommodation and the dissipation of energy in the contact area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the 1-day compressive strength of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) made with any combination of powders and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as silica fume (SF), fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast slag furnace (GGBSF), recycled glass powder (GP), rice husk ash (RHA), fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC3R), metakaolin (MK), limestone powder (LP), and quartz powder (QP). A total of 604 data from scientific literature were used to train the one hidden layer ANN model by using the k-fold validation procedure. Furthermore, 90 UHPC mixtures were experimentally performed to validate the proposed ANN model. The performance of the model was assessed using several statistical performance indexes: Ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), root mean square error (RSME), normalized mean bias error (NMBE), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, and coefficient of multiple determination (R2). Connection weight approach (CWA) algorithm was utilized to analyze the relationships between the UHPC components and the 1-day compressive strength. The results indicated that the ANN is an efficient model for predicting the early strength (1-day compressive strength) of UHPC achieving R2 values of 0.88 and 0.86 on the test data and experimental data, respectively, even when the experimental dosages included combinations of components that were not found in the training data. The results of the CWA analysis indicated that SCM such as MK, FC3R, SF, and LP, as well as other factors such as virtual packing density, improved the early strength of UHPC, whereas FA, GP, and RHA were pointed out as harmful for the one-day compressive strength. As conclusion, the ANN model could be helpful in the developing of UHPC with early strength needs by preselecting the combinations of available SCM and powders that have better results in the model at lower cost. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

	abstract = {One of the most promising areas in which social assistive robotics has been introduced is therapeutic intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (CwASD). Even though there are promising results in therapeutic contexts, there is a lack of guidelines on how to select the appropriate robot and how to design and implement the child–robot interaction. The use of participatory design (PD) methods in the design of technology-based processes for CwASD is a recognition of the stakeholders as “experts” in their fields. This work explores the benefits brought by the use of PD methods in the design of a social robot, with a specific focus on their use in autism spectrum disorders therapies on the Colombian autism community. Based on what proved to be effective in our previous research, we implemented participatory methods for both the CwASD and the stakeholders. The process leverages the active role of participants using a focus group approach with parents and specialists, and scene cards, narrative and handmade generative methods with the children. To overcome some challenges of traditional PD processes, where not all community actors are considered, we included a Colombian community consisting of therapists, nurses, caregivers and parents. The proposed PD process provides an opportunity to learn from several community actors (and thus different cultural and social aspects of developing countries), improving traditional robot design methods. In this way, the findings are summarized through a set of guidelines regarding the design of a social robot-device suitable to be implemented for robot-assisted therapy for CwASD. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The aforementioned company requested this type of study to consider the possibility of establishing its interconnection solutions using this technology in that region. For this purpose, a characterization of the area was made with the corresponding cartographic information in conjunction with the specialized platform of reference in geographic information systems ArcGIS, and the respective radio link was simulated with the Xirio Professional platform. The simulation results obtained for the RuralConnect Generation TVWS Radio G3 white space device, under different configurations such as transmission power, propagation model, frequency, modulation scheme, among others, show an unavailability of 0.00335 and 0.00003, and a fidelity of 0.0279 and 0.0002 for the worst and best case, respectively. For the Adaptrum ACRS2.0 device, with the same configurations, an unavailability of 0.00176 and 0.00002, and a fidelity of 0.0147 and 0.0001 are obtained for the worst and best case, respectively.

	abstract = {This paper presents the study of brain-heart interactions in pediatric patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A comparison between pre- and post- treatment stages was treated, searching to analyze the therapy effect. For this purpose, polysomnography signals were characterized, making use of electroencephalography and electrocardiography to compute the heart rate variability. Physiological networks analysis was driven through the computation of Granger causality to find interactions among brain and heart in both directions. Also, a proposal based on artificial neural networks was employed to include a nonlinear Granger causality sense. A preprocessing was implemented, according to five spectral subbands for the brain case, associate to five rhythms, and three for the heart case. Results showed that the treatment allowed recovery of connections mainly in subsystems involving the delta and gamma subbands. Finally, a notorious difference was evidenced between the results obtained with both methods where the nonlinear analysis obtained complementary results.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Rising concerns about climate change and the growth of energy consumption have led to the need to use technologies based on renewable sources. Wind energy is one of the most promising renewable technologies with an increasingly important role. Particularly Savonius Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (SVAWT) have several advantages for certain geographical conditions attracting designers to research them. The present study introduces the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as a tool for evaluating multiple SVAWT configurations and estimating the influence of rotor geometric parameters on SVAWT performance. For this purpose, CFD simulations are developed for different SVAWT configurations modeled parametrically through the rotor geometric parameters. The numerical solutions obtained are used to generate a Response Surface (RS). The RS is evaluated by finding satisfactory quality metrics. The influence of the geometric parameters is estimated using the selected RS. As a result, an experimental space is proposed where it is more likely to find the values in the geometric parameters that maximize the SVAWT performance. This research provides tools for large-scale evaluation of SVAWTs. Therefore, influence analysis of the parameters is carried out with fewer experiments. RSM and proposed experimental space serve as a base for future studies that optimize the SVAWT configuration. Copyright © 2021 by ASME},

	abstract = {Smart walkers are commonly used as potential gait assistance devices, to provide physical and cognitive assistance within rehabilitation and clinical scenarios. To understand such rehabilitation processes, several biomechanical studies have been conducted to assess human gait with passive and active walkers. Several sessions were conducted with 11 healthy volunteers to assess three interaction strategies based on passive, low and high mechanical stiffness values on the AGoRA Smart Walker. The trials were carried out in a motion analysis laboratory. Kinematic data were also collected from the smart walker sensory interface. The interaction force between users and the device was recorded. The force required under passive and low stiffness modes was 56.66% and 67.48% smaller than the high stiffness mode, respectively. An increase of 17.03% for the hip range of motion, as well as the highest trunk’s inclination, were obtained under the resistive mode, suggesting a compensating motion to exert a higher impulse force on the device. Kinematic and physical interaction data suggested that the high stiffness mode significantly affected the users’ gait pattern. Results suggested that users compensated their kinematics, tilting their trunk and lower limbs to exert higher impulse forces on the device. © 2021 by the authors.

The present proposal holds the use of AI algorithms to identify respiratory sounds that are associated with respiratory diseases (crackles and wheezes), for this, the database Respiratory Sound Database from the ICBHI 2017 Challenge was employed. The proposed models use statistics of time and frequency features, and a multi-label approach for the classification, which is a different approach from that used in related work, where a multi-target approach is employed. As a result, three machine learning algorithms were trained for both a multi-label and a multi-class classification, obtaining comparable results between them.

	abstract = {Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a high-tech kind of concrete which exhibits superb mechanical properties and improved durability. Over the last years the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) as partial substitution of cement and silica fume has been the object of great interest by the scientific community in order to reduce the high costs and carbon footprint of UHPC. Some of the more promising applications of this type of special concrete, such as the seismic retrofitting of non-ductile existing structures, require the development of high or ultra-high early strength. However, the replacement of cement and silica fume can result in the modification of some properties such as the early strength of UHPC, which usually needs great amounts of cement and silica fume. On the other hand, the use of several SCM has as outcome a highly complex material, which makes it more difficult to understand the effect of each component and their interactions on early strength. This study is aimed to develop an artificial neural networks (ANN) approach to predict the seven-day compressive strength of UHPC, being able to incorporate several SCM such as silica fume, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, recycled glass powder, rice husk ash, fluid catalytic cra-cking catalyst residue, metakaolin, limestone powder, in addition to mineral filler such as quartz powder. A total of 523 data from previous published works was used to train the one-hidden-layer ANN model. The model was also validated by performing experimental works. Besides, Connection-Weight-Approach algo-rithm (CWA) was used to analyse the relationships between the UHPC‟s components and the seven-day compressive strength. The results pointed out that the ANN is an efficient model for predicting the early strength (7-day compressive strength) of UHPC even when SCM are incorporated. © 2021, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

The irradiance, temperature and load values for each time step are managed on Matlab and sent to OpenDSS for the calculation of three phase power flow. The model was tested with the Comprehensive Test Feeder (CTF) for different amount of realizations presenting convergent values after 2000 realizations. The circuit of the CTF was tested obtaining a voltage profile and three phase power flow with a maximum error of 2.78% compared with the original results. The CTF was modified adding 4 PV generation systems to low-voltage nodes with a 10.16% of rated power penetration with respect to the original load. The simulation allows to analyze the power flows of the feeder with PV generation and further variables by adding modules to the framework. © 2019 IEEE.},

Currently, this estimation is widely used for the evaluation of athletes, workers, and the monitoring of patients in clinical settings. However, human pose estimation is not an easy task as it requires experts to manually assess the person’s position by using specialized equipment such as e-health devices (watches, bands, handles), markers, and high-cost cameras to monitor a limited scenario. The main goal of this article is to evaluate a marker-less low-cost computer vision system to get the automatic estimation of poses and fall detection on video by calculating the person’s joint angle with a high level of adaptability to any space. The proposed model is the first step in the construction of a tool that allows monitoring and generating alerts to prevent falls at home and clinical settings. © 2020 SPIE},

To obtain rates as high as the global ones, a CDW diagnosis in works is run and policy instruments that would allow the application of a circular economy concept as opposed to a linear economy are determined. It is found that economic and informative instruments are the most popular worldwide and the most requested at the national level, in comparison to regulatory instruments which currently prevail in Bogotá.

	abstract = {Background: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of permanent serious physical disability in childhood. Although many platforms have been developed, so far there are still not precise guidelines for the rehabilitation of the population with CP. The CPWalker is a robotic platform for the rehabilitation of children with CP, through which they can start experiencing autonomous locomotion in the rehabilitation environment. It allows the possibility of free movement and includes physical and cognitive interfaces into the therapy. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of the CPWalker-based rehabilitation intervention in children with CP by comparing different gait parameters before, during and after the use of the platform. Findings: The evaluation was divided in three stages where the gait parameters and symmetry indexes of eight subjects with CP were evaluated. In the first stage patients walked only with the help they receive normally in daily life. During the second stage they walked with the CPWalker and finally, in the third stage, they repeated their gait without the platform. In all stages they wore an inertial G-Sensor while walking through the hospital facilities. The results showed statistical significant differences in several spatio-temporal parameters, pelvic angles and general gait cycle parameters, with and without the use of the robotic device. For the eight patients: cadence, speed and stride length presented similar values when comparing before and after the therapy. However, they decreased during the intervention (both means and standard deviations). No significant differences were found in the symmetry indexes with the use of the platform. In spite of this, a reduction in the pelvic angles ranges and propulsion was observed. Conclusions: The effect of using the device was analyzed for spatio-temporal parameters, pelvic girdle angles and general gait cycle parameters. Among the eighteen initial parameters, seven presented a statistical significant difference when comparing stage 2 of the intervention with stages 1 and 3. Those changes showed the potential of the CPWalker to improve muscular strength and gait patterns of the patients with CP in the long term and to provide useful information for the design of the future generations of rehabilitation robotic devices. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Precision medicine is the Holy Grail of interventions that are tailored to a patient’s individual characteristics. However, conventional clinical trials are designed to find differences in averages, and interpreting these differences depends on untestable assumptions. Although ideal, a constant effect would facilitate individual management. Another consequence of a constant effect is that the outcome variance would be the same in treated and control arms. We reviewed the literature to explore the similarity of these variances as a foundation for examining whether and how often precision medicine is definitively needed. Methods: We reviewed parallel trials with quantitative outcomes published in 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013. We collected baseline and final standard deviations of the main outcome. We assessed homoscedasticity by comparing the variance of the primary endpoint between arms through the outcome variance ratio (treated to control group). Results: The review provided 208 articles with enough information to conduct the analysis. One out of seven studies (n = 30, 14.4%) had statistically different variances between groups, leading a non-constant-effect. The adjusted point estimate of the mean outcome variance ratio (treated to control group) is 0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97). Conclusions: We found that the outcome variance was more often smaller in the intervention group, suggesting that treated patients may end up pertaining more often to reference values. This observed reduction in variance might also imply that there could be a subgroup of less ill patients who derive no benefit, which would require studying whether the effect merits enduring the side effects as well as the economic costs. We have shown that the comparison of variances is a useful but not definitive tool for assessing whether or not the assumption of a constant effect holds. © 2019 Cortés J et al.},

	abstract = {The Colombian Swine Industry (CSI) market is managed by importers, technified pig farmers, and small pig producers. CSI is important for agriculture due to sustainable objectives. CSI wants to encourage profitability in order to enter new markets and satisfy local demand. One of the strategies proposed in this research is capitalization of Knowledge Management (KM) since pig's production cycle is relatively short and it encourages the return of investment for Colombian farmers. However, small pig farmers have many limitations due to the lack of technology, high production cost, lack of resources, and production and training incentives, those are main issues to encourage pork commercialization along with quality, biosecurity, and traceability. This article aims to identify the dimensions, subdimensions, and variables for competitiveness and KM that exist in the literature and have been applied to the Swine Industry (SI) to identify and incentivize CSI profitability. Firstly, to design those theoretical dimensions, subdimensions, and variables proposed for competitiveness and KM in CSI, 90 articles were reviewed; they were classified, analyzed and consolidated. Among the most outstanding results, to measure the global pig industry (GPI) competitiveness, authors have focused on costs, revenues, and traceability which have been determined on the literature as environmental, profitability and Supply Chain (SC) design and management in SI. Secondly, this research complements the literature in designing KM dimensions, sub-dimensions, and variables to measure SI profitability. Six competitiveness dimensions proposed in this research were constructed from the literature: environment, SC design and management, cost-effectiveness, quality management, human resource management, and innovation management; and KM dimensions for agglomerations are four: profitability, SC design and management, KM capacity and innovation, and agglomeration performance. The research perspective is the validation of the dimensions in other industries. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Latin America region sustains around one-tenth of global population; while average GDP per capita is medium-high, the region exhibits great socio-economic contrasts. Formally, the registered generated waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is lower than the world average but there is a substantial informal recycling and reuse system. In this chapter, we determine the impact of public policy instruments through systems dynamics modeling of the physical, economic, and information flow of household TV, fridges, computers, mobile phones, and light bulbs life cycle. We estimate country performance based on data drawn from major cities. Three countries are modeled, each with different WEEE management characteristics. Using sensitivity scenarios, we determine the policies with stronger effect in reuse, collection, dismantling, recycling, and material recovery. The outcome variables evaluated are hazardous, valuable, and landfill materials, as well as energy consumption; informal recoverers are intrinsically included in the models as well as the reduction of environmental and health impacts, under the umbrella of an integral management model. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {By 2050, growth population worldwide will demand a great amount of resources, specially in agricultural sector. In order to supply such resources, farmers will need advance tools and techniques to improve the efficiency along all farming processes e.g. precision farming, Unmanned Vehicles Systems (UVS). This paper shows the simulation results of an algorithm developed to perform the path planning process for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) autonomously, in agricultural environments. The aim of this project is to automate such process and provide the appropriate conditions to execute further supervision activities. The algorithm takes into account photogrammetric parameters such as the ground sample distance (GSD) and the overlap between photos. Image processing techniques are implemented to identify the crop boundary and rows’ orientation. The project was developed using open-source tools such as OpenCV, ROS and Gazebo. The paths generated by this algorithm allow the UAV not only to go across the identified crop following the row orientation, but also to guarantee the desired resolution, specified by the GSD. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The objective of the research is to obtain a theoretical model that characterizes an optical fiber sensor. To achieve this, the change in the properties of the light rays that propagate through the core of the fiber was characterized, when the medium undergoes a fold proportional to the deformation of a set of four springs that supports the weight of a C2 vehicle (two axis). The deformation altered the angle of curvature (α) of the glass fiber, which in turn affected the propagation of light due to the presence of reflected and refracted waves. This event modified the magnitude of the transmission coefficient (T) that was evaluated in the receiver.

Its result can be used in the generation of strategies for the optimization of radiotherapy treatments. The analysis of this type of data requires that the specialist performs the manual counting of colony forming units (CFU), i.e., find every cell that retains the ability to produce a large progeny. This task is time consuming, prone to errors and the results are not reproducible due to specialist subjective assessment. Digital image processing tools can deal with the flaws described above. This article presents a new technique for automatic CFU counting. The proposed technique extracts the regions of interest (ROIs), where a local segmentation algorithm finds and labels the CFUs in order to quantify them.

The field of medicine and more specifically, medical devices allow us to contemplate a shared vision of interconnected sensors that can improve medical care services, with the possibility of the appearance of new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) promise to be the field to follow in the near future. This paper offers an approach to the implementation of a real-time monitoring system on the main variables of a Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) in the imaging service of a fourth level hospital through the IoT. The information obtained about the different sensors implemented in the medical team, suggested relevant information about the importance of monitoring the main variables that are directly related to the operating specifications suggested by the manufacturer of the medical equipment. The data collected were analyzed using the “regression” diagnostic test as a probabilistic strategy to look for a predictive value that suggests a possible failure of the medical team. The results showed that the information collected suggests the importance of monitoring the operating parameters of the CAT continuously given the behavior of some atypical data that were obtained, although there was no failure in the time window where the CAT was performed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Recently, bioplastic have generated an increasing interest as an alternative to conventional plastics. For this reason, their manufacture using the traditional techniques used for the production of plastics, such as extrusion, would help transferring bioplastics production to an industrial scale. In this way, the preparation of wheat gluten bioplastics by extrusion was the main objective of this research, modifying their structure by varying the pH value or by incorporating additives (glyoxal or xanthan gum). These bioplastics were characterized by the measurement of their mechanical properties and their water uptake capacity, proving that the modification of bioplastics cause variations in their properties. Thus, extrusion resulted in a greater gluten-plasticizer compatibility compared to compression, as denoted the temperature ramp tests, especially in the presence of additives (ie. Xanthan gum, glyoxal). Moreover, tensile strength was enhanced at pH 9, probably due to bonding promotion at alkaline conditions. These results demonstrate the great potential of these materials for the replacement of conventional plastics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article studies the cash distribution problem for bank correspondents that are geographically dispersed, and the associated risk indicators, service times, and logistics costs. The proposed model is a variant of the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) that considers risk-management strategies. The model considers a single cash center with unlimited capacity, from which cash deliveries are carried out by a single vehicle with limited capacity for cash distribution. The bank correspondents to which the cash deliveries are made handles a limited storage capacity. This paper considers the routing decisions of vehicles with hard time window, and risk constraints focused on inducing unpredictability of routes in a cash supply chain. The proposed model is denoted as a risk constrained inventory routing problem with time Windows (RcIRPTW). A mathematical formulation based on mixed-integer programming is proposed, studying the impact of incidents risks in the transport of cash, generating computational experiments on test instances where four types of variations of the IRP are evaluated with several random demand scenarios. The results show the importance of simultaneously optimizing inventory decisions considering routing and inventory costs along with the consideration of risk mitigation strategies. These risk constraints force changing the routes of the vehicle, reducing incidents rates, and reducing route predictability for secure transportation and logistics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The rigorous control of temperature and relative humidity allows the physical and chemical properties of the medicines to be conserved, according to the suggestion of suppliers and current laws that regulate the conservation of medicines. The Internet of things (IoT) allows for monitoring and controlling specific areas by obtaining and publishing relevant data directly in the cloud, enabling intelligent systems to make early decisions when an abnormality is present in the area. However, for the IoT to fulfill its purpose, there must exist a permanent connection of things to the Internet, which is a challenge when there is low or no connection. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to implement a monitoring system for environmental variables under the condition of low or no Internet connectivity, using alternative technologies such as (GSM) for transferring data to the cloud. As a result of this work, the design and implementation of a continuous monitoring system for environmental variables in the hospital pharmacy area is presented.

	abstract = {Due to the recent rise in the use of lower-limb exoskeletons as an alternative for gait rehabilitation, gait phase detection has become an increasingly important feature in the control of these devices. In addition, highly functional, low-cost recovery devices are needed in developing countries, since limited budgets are allocated specifically for biomedical advances. To achieve this goal, this paper presents two gait phase partitioning algorithms that use motion data from a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the foot instep. For these data, sagittal angular velocity and linear acceleration signals were extracted from nine healthy subjects and nine pathological subjects. Pressure patterns from force sensitive resistors (FSR) instrumented on a custom insole were used as reference values. The performance of a threshold-based (TB) algorithm and a hidden Markov model (HMM) based algorithm, trained by means of subject-specific and standardized parameters approaches, were compared during treadmill walking tasks in terms of timing errors and the goodness index. The findings indicate that HMM outperforms TB for this hardware configuration. In addition, the HMM-based classifier trained by an intra-subject approach showed excellent reliability for the evaluation of mean time, i.e., its intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was greater than 0 . 75 . In conclusion, the HMM-based method proposed here can be implemented for gait phase recognition, such as to evaluate gait variability in patients and to control robotic orthoses for lower-limb rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Studies based on the cardiac and respiratory system have allowed a better knowledge of their behavior to contribute with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with them. The main goal of this project was to analyze the behavior of the cardiorespiratory system in healthy subjects, depending on the body position. The electrocardiography and respiratory flow signals were recorded in two positions, supine and sitting. Each signal was analyzed considering sliding windows of 30 s, with and overlapping of 50%. Temporal and spectral features were extracted from each signal. A total of 187 features were extracted for each window. According to statistical analysis, 148 features showed significant differences when comparing the position of the subject. Afterwards, the classifications methods based on decision trees, k-nearest neighbor and support vector machines were applied to identify the best classification model. The most advantageous performance model was obtained with a linear support vector machine method, with an accuracy of 99.5%, a sensitivity of 99.2% and a specificity of 99.6%. In conclusion, we have observed that the position of the body (supine or sitting) could modulate the cardiac and respiratory system response. New statistical models might provide new tools to analyze the behavior of these systems and the cardiorespiratory interaction complexity. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Although long/continuous metallic chips are easily recycled by melting, this is not the case for discontinuous milling chips. The present study aimed to reduce waste generation and to facilitate the use of this byproduct in order to obtain a metallic-oxide composite. Chips were collected after machining Al-Si-Zn-Mg alloy parts, and powders were obtained through grinding processes. Grinding was performed at 45, 69, and 94 h, with grinding bodies/chips volume ratios of 6:1, 8:1, 10:1 and 12:1. The resulting powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, laser granulometry, and X-ray diffraction. After grinding, the particles were compacted and sintered, and hardness was evaluated. It was found that metallic powder is formed through plastic deformation, hardening, fracture, and dynamic recrystallization. It was possible to obtain samples with lower apparent density and higher hardness by powder metallurgy from Al-Si-Zn-Mg alloy chips than from the bulk. Powder was obtained after grinding, and samples were obtained by compacting and sintering. The higher hardness value was attributed to the presence of Al2O3 formed in the particles during grinding, which acts as a second reinforcing phase in the sintered samples, and as a retardant of intermetallic phase growing. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The water allocation problem in a river basin is at the core of water resources management. Nowadays, many hydro informatics decision support systems provide sophisticate water resources simulation and planning tools. However, social aspects and multi-user communication in real time are missing from many of the models. A simple stakeholder oriented analysis only provides the information related to the availability of water resources in a river basin. The variability of the weather and climate of a region added to the groundwater exchanges, the multiple water streams, the environmental impacts and the large number of user interactions make the water allocation a complex computational problem. This study presents a web platform based on python code that integrates the everyday interactions for an IWRM (integrated water resources management). The proposed python library works as a tool for simulate, plan and evaluate IWRM scenarios. This hydroinformatic integrated web tool (HIWEB) simulates a reservoir behavior representing the operational rules as well as its interaction with irrigation districts. The information required for the water balance in a catchment is handled in a database. The toolbox provides specific modules for quantifying irrigation consumption, domestic and industrial water demands. In order to validate the processes represented and the results obtained, the tool is tested on the Coello river basin in Colombia and its results are compared with WEAP and RIBASIM, two worldwiderecognized water allocation tools. This project is in the framework of S-Multistore, an international collaborative research and innovation project, and it is expected to be extended to include a standardized methodology for sustainability assessment of the resources. © 2019, IAHR.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) became established during the last decade as an emerging technology with considerable potentialities and applicability. Its paradigm of everything connected together penetrated the real world, with smart devices located in several daily appliances. Such intelligent objects are able to communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures, thus generating a more concrete integration between real world and computer-based systems. On the downside, the great benefit carried by the IoT paradigm in our life brings simultaneously severe security issues, since the information exchanged among the objects frequently remains unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at hand proposes COSMOS (Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet of Things), a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our sentinel shields the IoT devices using multiple defensive rings, resulting in a more accurate and robust protection. Additionally, we discuss the current deployment of the sentinel on a commodity device (i.e., Raspberry Pi). Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the sentinel, demonstrating that it performs meticulously even in heavily stressing conditions. Each defensive layer is tested, reaching a remarkable performance, thus proving the applicability of COSMOS in a distributed and dynamic scenario such as IoT.With the aim of easing the enjoyment of the proposed sentinel, we further developed a friendly and ease-to-use COSMOS App, so that end-users can manage sentinel(s) directly using their own devices (e.g., smartphone). © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Biomechatronic systems integrate mechanisms, sensor integration, control strategies, human-robot interaction, and signal processing techniques. This chapter stresses the biomechatronic conception of robotic agents that interact with patients undergoing rehabilitation programs. In this context, the main role of social robotic agents is to act as companions or assistants in a specific task, which is intended improve patients' performance or increase engagement during the therapy. Social robots are required to contain a series of features that allow them to interact in an effective way, providing adaptability and flexibility to human environments. In this work, two robot-based therapy models are presented. The first intervention with a social robot was held in a cardiac rehabilitation service. Subsequently, this work has been extended to a neurological rehabilitation scenario. That way, the corresponding clinical context in which the system was deployed is described, followed by the proposed custom human-computer interface that was designed with two purposes. In the first instance, the interface allows the patient to observe the acquired sensory data during the therapy. Likewise, this system serves as a means of communication between the robot and the user. Two experimental studies were performed in the cardiac and neurological rehabilitation contexts. Important results showed that the robot assistance during the therapy has a positive impact, which is reflected in the decreasing of risk factors such as high heart rate values or fatigue perception and the improvement of patients' performance indicators such as cervical and thoracic postures. A positive attitude toward the robot role and patients was observed, and also greater motivation for patients to follow the rehabilitation treatment and improve their own performance according to the robot's interaction. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The arrays were inscribed in cyclic transparent optical polymer fiber through the direct-write, plane-by-plane inscription method using a femtosecond laser. Two arrays with four FBGs each were positioned on a rotary spring, and a numerical analysis using the finite-element method was performed to evaluate the sensors' behavior under different loading conditions. Experimental tests were performed on the spring, and the results show that the FBGs responses follow the predicted numerical simulations. In addition, a Kalman filter was applied on the response of the FBGs for sensor fusion, leading to a more accurate torque estimation, where the relative error for the torque estimation was improved by a factor of 7. Furthermore, transverse forces were applied on the predefined points of the spring in order to show the ability of the quasi-distributed sensor approach to identify external mechanical disturbances on the spring. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

The widely-used techniques, such as the inverse transformation, convolution, and rejection-acceptance methods, involve a significant amount of statistical work and do not provide satisfactory results when the data do not conform to the known probability density functions. This study aims to propose an alternative nonparametric method for generating random variables that combines kernel density estimation (KDE), and radial basis function based neural networks (RBFBNNs). We evaluate the method’s performance using Poisson, triangular, and exponential probability density distributions and assessed its utility for unknown distributions. The results show that the model’s effectiveness depends substantially on selecting an appropriate bandwidth value for KDE and a certain minimum number of data points to train the algorithm. the proposed method enabled us to achieve an R2 value between 0.91 and 0.99 for analyzed distributions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Organizational behavior and organizational cognitive neuroscience are newly established interdisciplinary fields that use scientific techniques to answer questions about behaviors within organizations. Clarifying the more precise role of emotions and their regulation in forming a judgment in different managerial decision-making contexts, exploring how team members function synchronously, and the links between psychophysiological traits and how they relate to leadership, have been recurring subjects of interest. In this document, we present the psychophysiological response of eight senior project managers and eight junior project managers as they are faced with a challenging situation designed to assess some of the most relevant personal skills in project management: teamwork, management, problem, and conflicts resolution. Noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG), voice recording (VoR) and video recording (ViR) were performed during the application of an Assessment Center evaluation in addition to before and after heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurements. The results suggest that the voice frequency is related to the task that a subject performs. In this case, an activity that requires active discussion causes a person to talk at a higher pitch, which is the mean value of the fundamental frequency of the voice. In relation to the analysis of the voice depending on the project management expertise, no significant differences were found for calculated voice features. These results suggest that the voice features are not related with the project management expertise. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation of facial redness for junior project managers groups was higher than those of the senior manager groups. This indicates that even though facial readiness was not universally higher for the junior project manager, it is much more prevalent in those with the shorter project management expertise. With respect to the estimation of subject's task engagement, measured through head movement cue analysis, it can be said that this method of engagement estimation proved to be in accordance with the expert psychology's opinion. In concern with EEG, no statistically significant differences were found in frontal asymmetry value between the discussion stage and the presentation and ideation stage and between Senior and Junior managers in the discussion stage. Regarding the before and after heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurements, even though, in general all three variables had a discernible behavior (HR and BP increased while SpO2 decreased), no statistical relevant differences were found in the pre and pose measurements. However, it can be said that the Assessment Center evaluation induced a physiological response on the subjects since, at least one of three variables varied for each subject. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {The Coello river basin has been studied in the past with conceptual models that show the high importance of the spatial representation for water availability and contamination in the central region of Colombia. The state-of-the-art modelling software comprise a large gamma of open source and commercial software. However, still spatial distributed systems are limited in their application and their flexibility to represent regional interactions. For this purpose and to be able to analyze the Coello river basin, this work uses the concept of the distributed Tracer-Aided Catchment model (TACD). The concept of Tracer aid (TAC) uses a gridded system that comprises upper zones that can be homogenous and groundwater systems that have interactions. This was an important component due to the future research in the mining industry in the region. For now, the adaptation from an old format in a PCRASTER library has been updated to the latest Python. This updated version will be referred as TACD2. To evaluate the distributed hydrological modelling tool a model for the Coello was build. The model parameters were calibrated to minimize the Nash-Sutcliffe error between observed and estimated flow data. However, water balance and the RMSE were evaluated. The distributed model allowed us to identify the hydrological sectorization of processes. The basin shows that the high region represents almost half of the flow that arrives to the Payandé station. Moreover, topographic variability of the basin might increase its vulnerability to extreme events. © 2019, IAHR.},

However, because of the high contents of cement and silica fume used, the cost and environmental impact of UHPC is considerably higher than conventional concrete. The use of industrial byproducts as supplementary cementitious materials, in the case of recycled glass powder and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC3R), as partial substitution of cement and silica fume allows to create a more ecological and cost-efficient UHPC. This research presents a study to determine the possibility of partial substitution of cement by FC3R in a previously optimized mixture of ultra-high-performance concrete with recycled glass. The results demonstrate that compressive strength values of 150 and 151 MPa without any heat treatment can be achieved, respectively, when replacing 11% and 15% of the cement with FC3R, for a determined amount of water and superplasticizer, compared to 158 MPa obtained for the reference UHPC without any FC3R content. The rheology of fresh UHPC is highly decreased by replacing cement particles with FC3R. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic radiation (known as electromagnetic emissions) related to processes of loading and fracture in different types of materials (from metals to rocks) has been widely reported. The physical mechanisms behind these emissions are still under discussion, however, it is commonly accepted that they are created by some of the micro-cracks that appear in the sample during fracture processes. Nucleation and growing of micro-cracks generate mechanical waves (acoustic emissions), therefore, each electromagnetic emission should be linked with some acoustic event. Furthermore, it is expected that the electromagnetic and acoustic activities (number of emissions per second) have the same general characteristics. Contrary to what is usually reported, we find that there are significant differences between acoustic and electromagnetic emissions in loading processes on rocks. These differences were detected during the compression of a typical laboratory-scale sample of granite when it is compressed at a rate of around 20 kPa/s. We found two important discrepancies: i) There were at least 20 electromagnetic bursts (out of around 200) that were not coincident with any acoustic event. ii) The electromagnetic activity in general shows its maximum value when acoustic activity is very low. Both emissions just coincide at the moment of the final collapse. These results strongly suggest the existence of a non-fracture mechanism related to the origin of electromagnetic emissions. This could have important consequences for the field of non-destructive assessment of materials and even in the study of earthquake precursors and forecasting. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In sectors where pipelines cross areas exposed to severe hazards or where the consequences are serious, traditional analyses based on the Risk Analysis Matrix (RAM) do not reflect the effect of the works and actions taken for risk control. That condition induces the idea of ineffectiveness or uselessness of the works and actions taken for protection and reinforcement. In this paper, for those situations it is proposed the analysis of hypothetical scenarios to determine which of them can become catastrophic, in order to assess which situations can trigger a catastrophe, and in consequence to take actions regarding them and thus to avoid the catastrophic situation. The suggested method consists in proposing scenarios of damages, corresponding an event of loss of product containment of a hydrocarbon transport system. In those scenarios, the following consequences of the oil spill are determined: the behaviour of the product, its route, the site of rupture, the possible threats that affect it, and the triggers of the threatening processes. Critical or catastrophic scenarios are selected and the chain of events regarding them is determined as detailed as possible. When analysing that chain, it is possible to find actions that may modify it, such as the control of the route so that it does not reach the sensitive elements, the strengthening of the pipeline to bear the hazards, the reinforcement of the ground to prevent the action of the hazards and to avoid that the hazard takes place. It must be determined how to protect the exposed elements and how to handle the spilled product to avoid the affectation of the elements mentioned above. For this point, it is important to know the infrastructure of the Contingency Plan and therefore to evaluate the possibility of strengthening it. Copyright © 2019 ASME.},

	abstract = {When a clayey soil is exposed to desiccation, water evaporates from the surface. During dry periods, the soil may suffer from shrinking phenomena, the saturation degree decreases and formation of cracks begins. At the same time, an overconsolidated soil appears at the surface of the deposit. Some previous studies devoted to this problem have highlighted the impact of cracks on desiccated profiles. However, these analyses have been carried out without considering the suction effect. The present study examines the specific case of the cracked soils found in the area of Sabana de Bogotá in Colombia. In this research, some soil models are tested using the Institut Français des Sciences et Technologies des Transports, de l'Aménagement et des Réseaux's geotechnical centrifuge. In this paper, the experimental procedure is first described. Then, the experimental results for the bearing capacity are presented. Finally, an analysis of the bearing capacity is carried out by considering the matric suction effect. This analysis compares different theoretical methods used to calculate the bearing capacity of shallow foundations resting on unsaturated soils with the experimental results obtained using the centrifuge. The results of the analysis underline the necessity of considering suction for the computation of the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils. © ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although musical neurofeedback is used in multiple works, few systems have been developed for stress regulation, and no systems have been developed for memory stimulation. For this reason, a music-based neurofeedback system for stress regulation and memory stimulation is proposed. This system was designed as a response to a previous research called “Neurophysiology of Emotions and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) against Women”. The designed system uses 8 EEG channels to analyze alpha and theta brain-waves from 4 areas of the brain: prefrontal, frontal, temporal and central. By recording a 30 seconds baseline, the system is capable to detect changes in the EEG signal that can be used for the interaction. For feedback, three musical features are modified depending on the EEG analysis: tempo, loudness and loudness of the voice of the singer. For testing the system, two protocols were designed, these protocols focused on memory stimulation and stress regulation. They were designed specifically for each one of the three types of feedback. These protocols were applied on two women (43 and 52 years old), both had been part of the previous project. Results are promising, showing changes in the EEG signals of the participants when comparing the first session and the last one. Changes in performance of some specific tasks in the protocols, show an adequate usability of the system. Further studies will be carry on in order to evaluate long-term effects of the system with more activities. © 2020 SPIE},

The lightweight aggregates were calcined clays and crushed clay bricks. In parallel, the effect of an internal curing agent composed of superabsorbent polymers (SAP) was evaluated. The properties evaluated in the fresh and hardened-state of concretes with a/c of 0,30 were: slum, air content, density, compression resistance, modulus of elasticity, initial superficial absorption and chlorine resistance. Results showed the efficiency of crushed clay bricks as internal curing, as well as the need for deeper research on the use of the evaluated lightweight aggregate as internal curing aggregate in concrete. Results indicate that the crushed clay bricks and the internal curing agent fulfill the behavior expected, in terms of strength and durability. However, the evaluated lightweight aggregate produces a reduction in the resistance and durability of the concrete. The observed behavior in strength and durability is especially variable for the age of 180 days, compared with conventional concretes. © 2019, Revista Ingenieria e Investigacion - Editorial Board.

	abstract = {Amongst the myriad of applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP), assisting Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) in chasing cyber criminals is one of the most recent and promising ones. The paper at hand proposes C^3-Sex, a smart chatbot to interact with suspects in order to profile their interest regarding a given topic. This solution is based on our Artificial Conversational Entity (ACE) that connects to different online chat services to start a conversation regarding a specific matter, in our case child pornography, as this is one sensitive sexual crime that requires special efforts and contributions to be tackled. The ACE was designed using generative and rule-based models in charge of generating the posts and replies constituting the conversation from the chatbot side. The proposed solution also includes a module to analyze the conversations performed by the chatbot and to classify the suspects into three different profiles (indifferent, interested and pervert) according to the responses that they provide in the conversation. Exhaustive experiments were conducted obtaining an initial amount of 320 suspect chats from Omegle, which after filtering were reduced to 35 useful chats, that were classified by C^3-Sex as 26 indifferent, 4 interested and 5 pervert individuals. © 2019 IEEE.},

Nevertheless, cloud robotics research still lacks comprehensive analysis on implementation issues and standardization. Experimentation testbeds designed for cloud robotics may accelerate research by providing a range of solutions while relieving researchers from implementing the whole cloud robotics stack. In this work, we present a case study over a cloud robotics testbed infrastructure in which we implement a cloud-based real-time autonomous navigation service for autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). An UGV located 4600 km away from the cloud platform makes use of such service to navigate throughout its environment, delegating to the cloud almost all computation. Results indicate the feasibility of real world cloud robotics implementations and we discuss the challenges and benefits of such approach. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, Social Assistive Robotics (SAR) is widely explored in different areas and scenarios. In cardiac rehabilitation, SAR has been recently implemented as a tool to improve the quality of the procedures and support patients to boost their performance. As cardiac rehabilitation comprises numerous sessions, such systems must guarantee to be effective in the long term. Therefore, to achieve this goal, it is important to understand how users, namely patients and clinicians who mostly know the needs and the therapy environment, perceive this technology. In this context, this paper presents the assessment of the attitudes towards a social robot in order to evaluate the expectation of potential new users, and perception of users who interacted with the social robot during a period of 18 weeks performing cardiac rehabilitation. A total of 43 participants (28 patients and 15 clinicians) were included in the study, and acceptance and perception factors were evaluated through a modified UTAUT questionnaire model and open discussion sessions. Results show that 75% of patients have positive thoughts regarding the usefulness, utility, safety, and trust perceived of a social robot, and 80% of clinicians consider that the robot is a useful tool for cardiac rehabilitation. Similarly, a more positive perception was noticed after the users interacted with the robot. Furthermore, this perception study allows the enhancement of the social model of interaction in the future, aiming to provide a more natural interaction trough personalized features, increasing social abilities and engagement of the users during the therapy. © 2019 by the authors.

This paper presents the interaction between clay soil with moisture content of 30% and diesel content of 1%, 3% and 6% of dry mass. The soil is taken from Colombia to know the effect of diesel on the index properties (moisture content, specific gravity of solids, Atterberg limits), cation-exchange capacity, mineralogy composition and unconfined compression strength; moreover, the samples are tested at different temperatures considering if it is known the presence of diesel or not in the soil because the presence of diesel increases organic components, then if there is known the presence the temperature is 50 ± 5 °C but 110 ± 5 °C. The diffractograms showed that diesel did not affect the mineralogical composition in the exposure period of 7 days, but in real cases the hydrocarbon may be for prolonged periods, months or even years. Independent of the test temperature, there was an increase in moisture content and decrease in specific gravity of solids as diesel content increased. The Atterberg limits had an uncertain behavior by the presence of diesel and change in the test temperature. The cation-exchange capacity was increased by the presence of diesel independent of the test temperature. The parameters of unconfined compression strength decreased as diesel content increased. The research concludes that diesel effects over geotechnical parameters of the soil generates negative impact, and projects that have soils with diesel need special attention, so it is important to keep doing research where diesel has more time of exposition in the soil. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To achieve better performance of the antenna, its height above ground, the length and diameter of the elements, their angle of inclination with respect to the axis of the antenna coordinates and the coupling with a 50Ω SMA type connection port were adjusted. The built antenna allowed to receive APT images in real time, with a maximum resolution of 120dpi, gain of 4.8dBi and frequency deviation of ±17 KHz. The modulated carrier arrived at a frequency of 137 MHz and was processed by devices and tools: RTL-SDR, Sharp SDR, audio piping and WXtoimg software for decoding images. It is concluded that in semi-urban environments the double cross antenna receives well APT images.

This study aims to develop an algorithm capable of differentiating a set of dermoscopic images depending on whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The priority of this research is to obtain the importance of each extracted feature. This work is focused on the ABCD rule feature analysis and it aims to find the relevance of each feature and its performance in a classification model. A relevant aspect of this study is the use of a heterogeneous database, where the images were uploaded by different sources worldwide. A combination of novel and previously used features are analyzed and their importance is computed by the use of a Gaussian mixture model. After selecting the most discriminant features, a set of classification models was applied to find the best model with the less quantity of features. We found that a total of 65.89% of the features could be omitted with a loss in accuracy, sensibility and specificity equal or lower than 2%. While similar performance measures have been employed in other studies, most results are not comparable, as the databases used were more homogeneous. In the remaining studies, sensitivity values are comparable, with the main difference that the proposed model is interpretable. © 2020 SPIE.},

Specifically, we explored the combined effect of human capital, research experience, and knowledge stock on licensing. We assumed that universities follow different patterns according to their internal strategy and resources. In order to deeper explore our results, we also investigated which combinations of the above factors led to the absence of licensing. To do so we used qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Sample included 39 Spanish public universities with on-campus education. Our results suggest that universities should strive to achieve a good mix of quality and quantity in terms of human capital and research experience in order to be active in licensing. Surprisingly, knowledge stock is rather irrelevant. We observe that subject-mix plays a role, as technical universities are more prone to generate licences.

	abstract = {The Colombian swine supply chain (CSSC) has a low level of national competitiveness compared to other supply chains such as coffee and fruit. While consumption of pork has raised in Colombia, most dealers are importing it from The United States and Canada, since farmers in those countries have received agricultural incentives to breed and commercialize pigs. Additionally, agribusiness have received technological developments to share information and develop the swine sector. This article aims to state theoretical Knowledge Management (KM) dimensions for CSSC that were built under authors’ assumptions on the literature. These were proposed to identify the competitiveness level in CSSC, because only two different kinds of measuring for swine competitiveness were found, but on the other hand, no model about Swine Supply Chain (SSC) was found. Perspectives of researching KM in CSSC would integrate stakeholders using a technological web platform which allows interchange of information among them. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models provide information about population dynamics under different conditions. In the study, four models were evaluated and employed to describe the growth kinetics of Nostoc ellipsosporum with different light wavelengths: Baranyi-Roberts, Modified Gompertz, Modified Logistic, and Richards. N. ellipsosporum was grown in BG-11 liquid medium for 9 days, using 12 hours of photoperiod and the following treatments: white light (400-800 nm), red light (650-800 nm), yellow light (550-580 nm) and blue light (460-480 nm). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The optical density (OD) was measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, using a spectrophotometer at 650 nm. The maximum cell growth was obtained under white light (OD650: 0.090 ± 0.008), followed by the yellow light (OD650 :0.057 ± 0.004). Conversely, blue light showed a marked inhibitory effect on the growth of N. ellipsosporum (OD650: 0.009 ± 0.001). The results revealed that the Baranyi-Roberts model had a better fit with the experimental data from N. ellipsosporum growth in all four treatments. The fondings from this modeling study could be used in several biotechnological applications that require the productionof N. ellipsosporum and its bioproducts. © 2020, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.},

	abstract = {Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) has shown to be an important tool to assist patients in physical rehabilitation. SAR is used to provide feedback about patient's state and performance to users and health professionals, therefore, patients are monitored by means of sensor interfaces. In this context, aiming to avoid over-training conditions, one of the most important parameter to monitor is the fatigue level. However, it is usually measured by subjective scales such as Borg scale, thus, there is a need to develop systems that are able to estimate fatigue with greater accuracy. It has been demonstrated that fatigue can be associated to the decreasing performance of the exercise. Hence, this work carried out a study to determinate which temporal and kinematic features are related to the fatigue level during a sit-to-stand test. The procedure consisted of sitting down and standing up from a chair while kinematic data were measured by a Kinect sensor, in order to relate kinematic data and fatigue. Results show that temporal features (time stand-to-stand and time sit-to-stand) and 3 kinematic features (max vertical-velocity of the spin base, max knee-flexo-extension velocity, and max hip-flexo-extension velocity), have a significant correlation with the fatigue level (p \lt 0.05). © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of on-demand internet services delivered over a network of a heterogeneous set of computing devices has created the need for high-performing dynamic systems in real-time. Services such as audio and video streaming, self-driving cars, the Internet of things (IoT), or instant communication on social networks have forced system designers to rethink the architectures and tools for implementing computer systems. Reactive programming has been advocated as a programming paradigm suitable for implementing dynamic applications with complex and heterogeneous architectural needs. However, there is no consensus on the core set of features that a reactive framework must-have. Furthermore, the current set of features proposed in reactive tools seems very restricted to cope with the actual needs for concurrency and distribution in modern systems. In this paper, several alternative semantics for distributed reactive languages are investigated, addressing complex open issues such as glitch avoidance, explicit distribution support, and constructs for explicit time management. First, we propose a reactive event-based programming language with explicit support for distribution, concurrency, and explicit time manipulation (ReactiveXD). Second, we present a reactive event-based semantic framework called Distributed Reactive Rewriting Framework (DRRF). The framework uses rewriting logic to model the components of a distributed base application, observables, and observers, and predicates supporting explicit time manipulation. Finally, to validate the proposal, the paper discusses the specification of the semantics of ReactiveXD and a scenario describing a case of intrusion detection on IoT networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

One of the possible consequences is the negative impact in the motor function of the patient, limiting their quality of life. For these reason, Brain-Computer Interfaces are studied as a tool for improving rehabilitation processes. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are no Brain-Computer Interface systems which use video-games for upper limb motor rehabilitation. This study aimed to design and assess a Human-Computer Interface that includes electroencephalography, forearm motion and postural analysis, with healthy subjects. This assessment was made by designing two scenarios in which the participant carried out exercises involving the mouth and the hand and forearm trajectory symmetry. Results show that the system is ready to be tested on patients, since the participants were comfortable using it. Also, the quantitative results, particularly, the metrics used in the video-game, are an important start for health professionals to characterize motor rehabilitation in stroke patients, enabling the path to the use of the designed system in motor rehabilitation therapies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This investigation was undertaken to determine the optimum conditions for physical-chemical treatment of waste water contaminated with heavy metals in the industry of metallic coatings. The industry uses substances such as: Inorganic acids, alkalis, acidic and alkaline metal salts, that has a high water demand in the processes of flushing and cleaning the parts to be coated. According to the preliminary characterization of samples and reported in the literature theory, physico-chemical process was implemented for the removal of contaminants that consisted in chemical oxidation of CN-ions, followed by chemical precipitation made next to a coagulation/flocculation and subsequent adsorption on activated coal. Laboratory scale tests showed the optimal conditions of treatment including chemical oxidation by the addition of 4.15 cm3 of H2O2 (30%) per gram of CN, chemical precipitation with NaOH to a pH of 12, followed by coagulation/flocculation with Fe2(SO4)3 at a speed of 135 rpm for 3 min and 20 rpm for 20 min and finally the addition of 1.0 g of adsorbent previously activated at 700°C. From this study, it is clear that the adsorption on activated carbon is highly efficient in the removal of heavy metals from industrial waste water from electroplating. However, it is also clear that the parallel application of the treatments, shown here, is more effective to completely remove contaminants such as lead, nickel, silver, and copper at laboratory scale, so it is recommended the simultaneous use of these physico-chemical processes. © 2019 Jacipt A.R.

It has been instrumented to measure various environmental variables, including relative humidity (RH), wind velocity, radiation and temperature. The climatic chamber has been calibrated so that it properly simulates each environmental variable as well as the heat-transfer mechanisms that affect desiccation in soil layers. First, a potential evaporation test was performed in a container filled with water. The weight of the water evaporated was measured, and the interaction with the artificial atmosphere was studied. Then, an actual evaporation test was performed on a soil layer, and the relations among environmental variables and soil properties such as soil temperature, water content and suction were determined. The principal results show the existence of a gradient of RH at the soil-atmosphere interface. Also, a comparison between potential and actual evaporation indicates that suction is the main soil property that affects the actual evaporation rate. © 2018 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, in Latin America, a huge amount of people are in a motor disability condition. This phenomenon generates difficulties to execute daily tasks, such as the feeding process. To mitigate the daily difficulties, assistance devices are needed. This paper describes the evaluation of a brain-computer interface (BCI) for meal assistance, based on the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), characteristic of the movement intention. The electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired and processed to extract features in the frequency and time domain. These features train a classification model that separates the movement intention from any other cerebral activity. The study was made with ten healthy people who were subjected to a test that corresponds to feed themselves ten times. The results obtained show that average time to activate the meal assistance device is less than 10 s, furthermore, the accuracy of the tests performed was 81.6%, i.e. there is a good differentiation between a movement intention from another activity. Finally, it was concluded that the purposed meal assistance device achieves the goal of allowing an autonomous feeding and leaves as a precedent an alternative to implementing assistance devices through a BCI. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

An analytical model was proposed and further validated with experiment tests, showing correlation with a coefficient of R = 0.998 between experiment and theoretical data, and reaching a maximum axial displacement range of 15 mm and no significant hysteresis. Furthermore, experiment tests were carried out attaching the validated sensor to the elastic tendon. Results of three experiment tests show the sensor's capability to measure the tendon's response under tensile axial stress, finding 20.45% of hysteresis in the material's response between the stretching and recovery phase. Based on these results, there is evidence of the potential that the fiber-optical strain sensor presents for future applications in the characterization of such tendons and identification of dynamic models that allow the understanding of the material's response to the development of more efficient interaction-control strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

The authors equipped professional Luigino skates with electronic instrumentation, with which it was possible to measure a high-performance skater’s linear speed and distance traveled of by means of Hall effect sensors and a magnet. To eliminate false measurements, a distance sensor was also installed in the skate skids to determine when the skate was in contact with the ground. This information was sent to the Internet through the MQTT protocol to a main broker that was responsible for the processing and visualization of the data. The linear velocity was validated at four speeds (0.8, 5, 8 and 10 km/h) using a treadmill. The error of the measurements was between 1% and 5%. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent rise in the use of lower-limb exoskeletons as an alternative for gait rehabilitation, gait phase detection has become an increasingly important feature in the control of these devices. In addition, highly functional, low-cost recovery devices are needed in developing countries, since limited budgets are allocated specifically for biomedical advances. To achieve this goal, this paper presents two gait phase partitioning algorithms that use motion data from a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the foot instep. For these data, sagittal angular velocity and linear acceleration signals were extracted from nine healthy subjects and nine pathological subjects. Pressure patterns from force sensitive resistors (FSR) instrumented on a custom insole were used as reference values. The performance of a threshold-based (TB) algorithm and a hidden Markov model (HMM) based algorithm, trained by means of subject-specific and standardized parameters approaches, were compared during treadmill walking tasks in terms of timing errors and the goodness index. The findings indicate that HMM outperforms TB for this hardware configuration. In addition, the HMM-based classifier trained by an intra-subject approach showed excellent reliability for the evaluation of mean time, i.e., its intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was greater than 0.75. In conclusion, the HMM-based method proposed here can be implemented for gait phase recognition, such as to evaluate gait variability in patients and to control robotic orthoses for lower-limb rehabilitation. © 2019 by the authors.

Through a literary review of 84 academic papers from 22 countries, 254 mentions of 30 lean tools were detected, developing a qualitative content analysis from identified trends of the main differences and similarities in the adoption of lean construction (LC) in Colombia, Latin America and the different continents. The results derived from a Pareto chart and an affinity analysis in which lean tools were reduced to 23 categories, show that the main practices of lean manufacturing and lean construction are Last Planner System, Building Information Models, Visual Management, among others. This study is part of a subsequent project that will take the conclusions of this qualitative analysis to suggest a guiding tool (based on the continuous improvement tools found) that correlates applicable lean approaches with the main actors of the supply chain of high value housing projects in Bogotá. Taking into account the research gap found, this study could serve as a basis for lean construction studies in countries similar to Colombia. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

The analysis confirms the modest orientation of Colombia’s industrial structure towards international markets. The SMEs that exported grew more in terms of industrial production than the non-exporting ones; in addition, they exhibited the greatest levels of capital and total number of employees. The hypothesis on pre-selection of SMEs to export according to labour productivity levels is also verified. Likewise, the companies that recorded the highest levels of productivity also presented the highest probabilities of exporting, although this probability registered a decreasing trend in the period analysed. The probability to export was also affected positively by those firms that did it in the past. © 2018 Universidad de Antioquia. All rights reserved.},

These indices were calculated through the geoprocessing of multi-spectral aerial images taken by a drone or UAVs, with the aim of identifying which zones of the crops are under stress, healthy or dense. The rice growing had an area of approximately 4,1 hectares and its location corresponds to the farm El Faro in the footpath Campo Hermoso within the municipal district of San José de Cúcuta – Norte de Santander. For this research, two flights were carried out, one at the beginning of the reproduction phase dated September 4th 2016 and the second one at the end corresponding to October 8th 2016; these flights were performed with a Iris+ 3DR drone, a canon S100 camera was implemented as a catch images sensor converted into NDVI by using a NGB filter (Near infrared, Green and Blue). As a result, 4 mosaics are shown, one NDVI and one GNDVI on September 4th 2016 and one NDVI and one GNDVI on October 8th 2016, each one of them were classified according to the characteristics observed in field in zones under stress or with low development, healthy and dense zones.

	abstract = {Over the last 20 years, remarkable advances have taken place in the research on reactive powder concrete (RPC). However, because of the high contents of cement and silica fume (SF) usually used in those types of concrete, the cost and environmental impact of RPC is considerably higher than conventional concrete. Hence, the use of supplementary cementitious materials as partial substitution of cement and SF has been an object of great interest by the scientific community. However, the replacement of cement and SF can result in the deterioration of certain properties of RPC, such as the early strength; however, RPC usually needs great amounts of cement and SF. This work presents a study to analyze the effect of metakaolin (MK) as a partial substitute of cement in a previously optimized mixture of RPC using statistical tools such central composite design, main effect plot analysis, and response surface methodology. In addition to MK, supplementary cementitious materials such as SF, limestone powder and recycled glass powder, and fine Type III cement were used. Based on the laboratory experiments results and statistical analysis, it was concluded than MK develops a high activity in the hydration process of RPC, helping it reach high strength at early ages, such as 1 and 7 days, which may be of interest for applications such as the connection of prefabricated elements or accelerated bridge construction. However, the effect of the partial substitution of Type III cement by MK on 28-day compressive strength was nonsignificant. Moreover, the MK inclusion in RPC provides a significant decrease in workability as the amount of MK increases.  © 2020 by ASTM International.},

	abstract = {The public private partnership model in Colombia has been the main vehicle to promote the development of transportation infrastructure during the last 20 years. Currently, the national government is developing the Fourth Public Private Partnership Road Program (4G) with a total investment of COP$53B (US$26,530) in 2013 and an average total length of 7,601 km (4,723 mi). In the development of this paper it will be quantified how 4G projects will change accessibility, goods transportation costs, and territorial cohesion in a future scenario when the road network will be finished. This goal will be supported by the creation of a database design in the geographic information system taking into account economic and technical characteristics to evaluate the accessibility and a generalized transport cost function (GTC) in each link covering the whole road network, as well as gross domestic product (GDP) in each project region. As a result, it is important to note that 4G projects will represent an important change and positive impact in variables of corridors in the national road network. Even if the results show that some regions will receive benefits, this research also shows that some regions will not present changes in accessibility, GTC, and territorial cohesion because the 4G corridors do not cover the whole country, but the advantages in some regions will encourage the country’s competitiveness, which could not be reality without the support of private participation. Finally, this research provides enough insight to outline a new program that couldcc, (GTC), and GDP in the regions. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.},

	abstract = {In previous approaches of robotics walkers, the user directly commands the robot motion during walking through a HMI. In this context, this chapter presents the implementation and validation of the concept of Cognitive HRI for human mobility assistance. In this approach, the user does not guide directly the walker during walking. In contrast, the walker follows close enough the user in order to provide partial body-weight support. This concept intends to achieve natural human-walker cooperation during the assisted-gait. This chapter also addresses the integration of the control strategy proposed in Chap. 3 on a robotic walker. That way, some remarks regarding the human-robot physical link demand a new human-walker parameters detection. Consequently, new validations were performed before performing the control implementation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) against women is a major problem in Colombia. Nowadays the question about the effects of violence on women and the identification of latent risks that affect their health, is increasingly relevant. This article describes a pilot study that aimed to measure electrophysiological signals corresponding to the emotional neurophysiological response of women who had experienced IPV in contrast to those who did not. Six healthy female adults, ranged in age from 18 to 55 years old enrolled in this study. For the measurement we used the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and an Auditory and Visual Emotional Memory Test (avEMT), and we recorded the EEG signal with a g.Nautilus 32 g.LadyBird. EEG signals acquired from baseline and during the tests were compared. As a result of IAPS test, we found for all the participants a higher power spectrum at low EEG frequencies and a decrease in power as the frequencies increase for baseline and emotional pictures. For the avMET, both groups show a higher power spectrum in the different phases of the task compared with the baseline, with an exception of one participant from the WIPV group who show the opposite tendency. Also, two machine learning models were trained and an accuracy of more than 85% were achieved to classify EEG signals from women who experienced IPV and women who had not. This research is an approach to the phenomenon of violence against women and broadens the understanding of the effects on emotional response and electrophysiological activation in women who have experienced this type of situation. © SPIE.

Different environmental variables such as relative humidity, wind velocity, radiation, and temperature have been measured. The climatic chamber was designed and calibrated to simulate properly each environmental variable and the heat transfer mechanisms during desiccation process. A potential evaporation tests was performed measuring the weight of water and actual evaporation tests were performed in a soil layer of Speswhite clay, in these tests, potential and actual evaporation rate were determined. This paper presents the evolution of the environmental variables and the soil properties such as soil temperature, water content, and suction during the evaporation process. As a result, a comparison between potential and actual evaporation rate indicates the large effect of suction on the actual evaporation rate. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

A multi-objective model based on mixed integer programming is proposed seeking three objectives: First, to minimize the total cost of transportation and the costs associated to the use of intermediate nodes. Second, to minimize the risks of product losses in transportation. Third, to minimize the environmental impact of CO2 emissions produced by transportation and storage operations. The proposed model is solved with two approaches: First, a commercial solver to compute the Pareto-optimal set of solutions. Second, a simulation-based optimization approach that allows to obtain statistically different but efficient solutions such that the decision-maker will be able to trade-off objectives while considering only Pareto optimal solutions. Experiments on random instances demonstrate the capability of the models and methods. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

	abstract = {The term Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a set of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination. The prevalence of CP is two–three per 1000 births. Emerging rehabilitation therapies through new strategies are needed to diminish the assistance required for these patients, promoting their functional capability. This paper presents a new robotic platform called CPWalker for gait rehabilitation in patients with CP, which allows them to start experiencing autonomous locomotion through novel robot-based therapies. The platform (smart walker + exoskeleton) is controlled by a multimodal interface that gives high versatility. The therapeutic approach, as well as the details of the interactions may be defined through this interface. CPWalker concept aims to promote the earlier incorporation of patients with CP to the rehabilitation treatment and increases the level of intensity and frequency of the exercises. This will enable the maintenance of therapeutic methods on a daily basis, with the intention of leading to significant improvements in the treatment outcomes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Hence, it is important to target this issue from a multi-perspective and interdisciplinary point of view. This full-day workshop will offer a forum for researchers from a variety of backgrounds to discuss the potentials and limitations of using social robots to promote physical activity.

Concrete samples with 10, 20 and 30 % of FCC incorporated as cement replacement were evaluated. As reference materials, concrete without addition and concrete added with 20 % of metakaolin (MK) were used. MK is a high performance pozzolan of chemical composition similar to the FCC. The properties studied, in addition to the compressive strength, were: water absorption by total immersion, porosity, surface absorption and capillary sorption. The results showed that the concrete added with FCC and MK had similar behavior, and were slightly higher than the control sample. The total absorption and porosity were below 5 % and 10 % respectively for all samples; this means that the incorporation of the addition reduces the permeability of concrete. In this sense, FCC is considered as a good alternative for producing more durable concrete, being the optimum percentage, 10 % cement replacement. © 2017, Revista Ingenieria e Investigacion - Editorial Board.

In the multitude of possible platforms, selecting the most suitable to implement a specific service is not straightforward, especially from a security perspective. This paper analyzes some of the most prominent proposals in the IoT platforms market-place, performing an in-depth security comparison using five common criteria. These criteria are detailed in sub-criteria, so that they can be used as a baseline for the development of a secure IoT service. Leveraging the knowledge gathered from our in-depth study, both researchers and developers may select the IoT platform which best fits their needs. Additionally, an IoT service for monitoring commercial flights is implemented in two previously analyzed IoT platforms, giving an adequate detail level to represent a solid guideline for future IoT developers. © 2018 by the authors.},

Winter, Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movement, Wiley, Hoboken, 2009, [1]). Neurological and age-related diseases affect human mobility at different levels causing partial or total loss of such faculty. In addition, mobility decreases gradually with age. Evidences show that mobility restrictions are also associated with cognitive and psychosocial disturbances, which further impairs the quality of life of the individual (A.S. Buchman et al., Cognitive function is associated with the development of mobility impairments in community-dwelling elders. Am. J. Geriatr. Psychiatr. 190(6):571-580, 2011, [2]). In this context, new technologies have emerged to improve the life conditions of people with motor impairments. Some remarks regarding the human locomotor system, mobility dysfunctions, assistive devices for enhancing mobility, functional compensation during walking and devices for gait rehabilitation will be presented in this chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {The binding energies of complexes of DNA nucleobase pairs are evaluated using quantum mechanical calculations at the level of dispersion corrected density functional theory. We begin with Watson-Crick base pairs of singlets, duplets, and triplets and calculate their binding energies. At a second step, mismatches are incorporated into the Watson-Crick complexes in order to evaluate the variation in the binding energy with respect to the canonical Watson-Crick pairs. A linear variation of this binding energy with the degree of mismatching is observed. The binding energies for the duplets and triplets containing mismatches are further compared to the energies of the respective singlets in order to assess the degree of collectivity in these complexes. This study also suggests that mismatches do not considerably affect the energetics of canonical base pairs. Our work is highly relevant to the recognition process in DNA promoted through the RecA protein and suggests a clear distinction between recognition in singlets, and recognition in duplets or triplets.

For this, algorithms were used in order to generate and control the movements joints of robot in a synchronized way. The high-level languages to program robots are based on three types of movement: joint interpolation (MOVEJ), linear interpolation (MOVES), and circular arcs (MOVEC), which are used to develop any type of task. In this work, these three movements are implemented in the industrial controller CompactRIO, as part of the reconditioning process of a robot manipulator of five degrees of freedom (5 DOF) whose controller was obsolete. As a result, it will have an interface in LabVIEW where you can view and modify the basic parameters implemented in the industrial controller. In addition, the results of the validation tests of the joint positions and the end effector of the manipulator will be found. © 2017 Jorge Luis Aroca Trujillo et al.},

The studied literature was classified based on a taxonomy proposed by the authors, consisting of 8 thematic areas which are: etiology, epidemiology, prediction, consequences, prevention, measurement, detection of falls and detection of daily activities. From the literature review it was concluded that the most important contributions of the electronic sciences emerge from the development of motion capture devices as well as from the different algorithms proposed to process the resulting information generated by these devices. Thanks to the combination of these two aspects (algorithms and devices) it was possible to measure accurately variables as walking speed, length and duration of the step, position of the center of gravity and postural balance. The measurement of these variables, in turn, has introduced significant advances in the form in which the risk of falling is assessed. Despite the above, there are many questions that must still be resolved, one of them is: ¿How to convert the quantitative information associated with measurement of biomechanical variables in to qualitative valuations? From the above, more specific questions arise as: ¿what are the acceptable limits for the asymmetry of the step? ¿How to determine when a level of postural balance can be considered unsafe?.},

The antenna has been located in Bogota (latitude: 4°36′34″N, longitude: 74°04′54″W; 25822 m above sea level), it has received Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) signals of good quality with circular polarization on the right (RHCP); those ones have been fed to a sharp SDR (generic software RTL-SDR) and decoded through the WXtoImg software in the receiver. In order to improve the performance of the antenna, the helix has been built with a coaxial cable of 0.0047λ diameter (RG-213 / U), the length of the feed cable has been minimized to 55 cm, (less than λ/2), and an impedance coupling network using a series stub has been designed. The physical design has represented an important aspect, since some wrong dimensions have caused distortions in the received signal. The experimental results show radiation diagrams with a gain of eight dBi and bandwidth of 30 KHz with respect to 3dB at the central frequency of 137 MHz, which are comparable with the simulations and theoretical analysis. With the above, the design of the circuit is validated; it guarantees its performance and confirms the practical utility of the antenna. © 2018 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. All rights reserved.},

Simplified models are proposed to describe the run-up and wave height attenuation in case of tsunamis. The results are calibrated in the case of important tsunamis having taken place in Asian region. The mechanical vulnerability of cylindrical metal tanks erected near the shoreline is also investigated. The fragility curves are then developed in order to describe the multimodal failure: overturning, rupture of anchorages and sliding, buoyancy, excessive bending effects or buckling. Corresponding fragility curves are developed under various conditions: height of tsunami waves, filling ratios and service conditions of the tanks, friction tank/ground as well as dimensions effects. Probabilistic description of the natural hazard and the fragility curves are presented. Sensitivity analysis is also performed in order to investigate the effect of various governing parameters. Furthermore, resilience concepts and metrics are proposed. Theoretical description of the damages and post-disaster recovery functions are discussed: plastic adaptation as well as elastic and plastic attractors. © 2016 The Author(s).

This analysis is done through the combination of the current and voltage harmonic distortions to determine the effect on the transformer temperature rise and his impact on transformer aging. The effects of current harmonics on transformer load losses and aging have been widely studied. In contrast, the effects of voltage harmonics remain still scarcely investigated, very few documents analyze this disturbance related to transformer aging and quite rarely it has been included in the transformer aging models operating under non-sinusoidal conditions. Both harmonic distortion effects will be compared through the transformer thermal-electrical model to characterize the transformer loss of life for different levels of voltage and current distortion. © 2017 IEEE.},

Thus, traffic congestion is high, generating long travel times for students, high operational costs, and mobility problems. This paper studies the impacts of a cooperative strategy between logistics operators using a mixed integer programming mathematical model, to find the optimal design of school routes on a network with the topology that describes the aforementioned road system. Two strategies are compared: a mixed loads strategy, where students from different schools share buses; and a single load strategy, where students from different schools cannot share buses. The objective is to minimize the total operational costs while satisfying the schools’ time windows. Comparative results of the two models using exact and heuristic approaches are presented. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

A numerical analysis of the material behavior and its interaction with the FBG sensor was performed through the finite element method. A simple, fast and prone to automation process is presented for the FBG embedment in both PLA and TPU structures. The temperature tests were made using both PLA-and TPU-embedded FBGs as well as an unembedded FBG as reference. Results show an outstanding temperature sensitivity of 139 pm/◦C for the FBG-embedded PLA structure, which is one of the highest temperature sensitivities reported for FBG-based temperature sensors in silica fibers. The sensor also shows almost negligible hysteresis (highest hysteresis below 0.5%). In addition, both PLA-and TPU-embedded structures present high linearity and response time below 2 s. The results presented in this work not only demonstrate the feasibility of developing fully embedded temperature sensors with high resolution and in compliance with soft robot application requirements, but also show that the FBG embedment in such structures is capable of enhancing the sensor performance. © 2018 by the authors.

The reinforcement was made using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP). In the test program, eight (8) clay masonry walls were built using hollow brick. Four (4) of them were 1,23 m long and 1,90 m high and the remaining four (4) were 2,47 m long and 1,90 m high. Four (4) walls were tested with a static lateral load and four (4) with a cyclic lateral load in its plane. Results revealed that the presence of the reinforcement material significantly increased the ultimate load and deformation capacity, provided that the material has a suitable anchoring system. © 2018, Revista Ingenieria e Investigacion - Editorial Board.

In order to improve performance of these solutions, this paper solves the centralized RCMPSP using Priority Rules (PR) heuristics as best-case scenario for GA initial population. Using recently improved heuristics, this research analyze 12 well known priority rules on 14 different sets of simultaneously scheduled multi-projects commonly found in literature, with some generalized characteristics such as activity on node, deterministic durations, limited global resources and minimum Total Makespan (TMS) as objective. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the initial population performance, experimental results are compared, in terms of TMS and average project delay (APD). Analysis results shows that GA approach can lead to better solutions in some cases, in terms of TMS and APD, using an improved initial population. © IEOM Society International.},

	abstract = {Development of children’s cognitive and perceptual skills depends heavily on object exploration and experience in their physical world. For children who have severe physical impairments, one of the biggest concerns is the loss of opportunities for meaningful play with objects, including physical contact and manipulation. Assistive robots can enable children to perform object manipulation through the control of simple interfaces. Touch sensations conveyed through haptic interfaces in the form of force reflection or force assistance can help a child to sense the environment and to control a robot. A robotic system with forbidden region virtual fixtures (VFs) was tested in an object sorting task. Three sorting tasks—by color, by shape, and by both color and shape—were performed by 10 adults without disability and one adult with cerebral palsy. Tasks performed with VFs were accomplished faster than tasks performed without VFs, and deviations of the motion area were smaller with VFs than without VFs. For the participant with physical impairments, two out of three tasks were slower with the VFs. This implies that forbidden region VFs are not always able to improve user task performance. Alignment with an individual’s unique motion characteristics can improve VF assistance. © 2018, © 2018 RESNA.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is a digital currency in which the need for a trusted third party is avoided. Instead, this digital currency is based on the concept of ‘proof of work’ allowing users to execute payments by digitally signing their transactions. Since electronic files can be duplicated, fraudulent transactions in the form of double-spend attacks – where users spend the same money at least twice – can happen. This paper is about attack models that can assign possible time advantage to attacker agents in the Bitcoin network. In particular, this paper presents: (i) two attack models in which partial advancement towards block production can be influenced by time and not only by the hashpower used to produce blocks of hashes, and (ii) algorithmic experimentation comparing these models against existing well-known hashrate-based attack models that do not consider time advantage. As a conclusion, this paper presents evidence on the fact that advantages are not negligible for cases in which an attacker has had enough time for secretly mining fraudulent blocks or significant control over the network. Also, the models presented in this paper help in supporting previous claims in the literature about how to correctly model and detect double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network. © 2016 The Author(s)},

To address real-time monitoring of modern distributed applications, we recently proposed REAL-T, a reactive event-based distributed programming language with explicit support for distributions and time manipulation. REAL-T allows programmers to instrument distributed applications to monitor and enforce specific behavior. It also supports requirements of modern reactive applications (responsiveness, resiliency, elasticity and asynchronous communication). The REAL-T programming model is very flexible, making the semantic specifications very challenging. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {Neurological disorders frequently affect walking function which is one of the most fundamental skills to improve quality of life and autonomy, and Lokomat has been a key piece for gait's rehabilitation. In this study, a diagnosis about the development of the Robot-assisted therapy rehabilitation with Lokomat in Colombia is made. The study was performed by collecting some anthropometric and demographic data of the patients that use Lokomat, followed by a survey of cognitive aspects. With the purpose to compare the current state of the robotic therapies it was found that in Colombia the benefits of this treatment have not being fully exploited. Regarding the cognitive aspects, most of the patients that use Lokomat as a rehabilitation therapy feel comfortable (47%), very safe (68%) and have a perpective of significant results with the therapy (68%). However, when compared the number of patients in therapy with Lokomat with the number of the population that has gait disabilities, it is found that few Colombians have access to this type of therapy. © 2017 IEEE.},

The article also proposes a preliminary protocol for the flexural design of masonry walls reinforced with FRP bars. The objectives of this investigation were: (1) evaluate the flexural behavior of masonry walls reinforced with FRP bars subjected to out-of-plane loads, and (2) develop preliminary design recommendations. Ten masonry walls, 2 m [6.6 ft] high, were subjected to out-of-plane loads, tested under quasi-static loading cycles. The test specimens included walls constructed using concrete and clay masonry units, reinforced with Glass FRP (GFRP) and Carbon FRP (CFRP) bars in different configurations. A l l the FRP-reinforced masonry walls showed a bilinear moment-deflection curve with one steep slope up to cracking of masonry and a decrease in stiffness after cracking. The majority of the walls failed due to crushing of masonry in the compression side. After failure occurred and as the out-of-plane load was progressively removed, the walls returned to a position close to the initial vertical position. In general, the approaches used to calculate flexural strengths and deflections provided good agreement with the experimental results. © 2017 American Concrete Institute. All rights reserved.},

Pastes with 100% ordinary Portland cement and blended cement pastes containing 20% by of weight volcanic materials were prepared. The monitoring and identification of the hydration characteristics were carried out using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at 7, 28, 90 and 360 curing days. The results indicated that the main phases of the blended cement pastes containing PVM were ettringite and calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), which confirmed the pozzolanic activity of this material. The blended cement pastes containing TVM exhibited no significant differences in hydration products compared to the reference pastes, due to its inert nature.},

Among the requirements of this type of construction are solicitations for vertical and lateral loads caused by wind or earthquake forces, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources Considering this, the use of Guadua angustifolia Kunth (Guadua a.) as a structural material has awaken a great interest, considering its renewability, high-speed growth, ecological benefits and because is easily obtainable all across the country. Due to the lack of additional information, structural joints in this type of materials, are usually pinned, assuming that there is no moment transmission between the different elements, however, some types of connections can partially restrict the rotation in the supports. Additionally, the degree of constrain that any support can provide to the column is a variable that has not been studied enough, despite being essential for modeling and structural design. In this work a connection between a column of Guadua a. and its foundation was studied. The influence of each component on the connection behavior under horizontal loads was assessed, testing seven different configurations. Monotonic and dynamic testing of connections as well as the characterization of the materials used in its construction were included in the experimental schedule. It was determined that the presence of mortar grouting together with the use of longitudinal bolts slightly increases the connection strength as drastically reduce its ductility. The use of transversal bolts is the best alternative to obtain a strong, stiff and ductile connection, especially when are combined with the use of hoops. © (2016) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown an association between alterations in laryngopharyngeal mechanosensitivity (LPMS) and dysphagia, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic cough hypersensitivity syndrome. A previous reliability study of a new laryngopharyngeal endoscopic esthesiometer and rangefinder (LPEER) showed high intra- and inter-rater reliability; however, its accuracy has not been tested. We performed an accuracy study of the LPEER in a prospectively and consecutively recruited cohort of 118 patients at two tertiary care university hospitals. Most of the patients were suffering from dysphagia, and all of them underwent a standard clinical evaluation and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing (FEESST) using a new sensory testing protocol. The sensory test included determinations of the laryngeal adductor reflex threshold (LART), the cough reflex threshold (CRT) and the gag reflex threshold (GRT). Abnormalities on these reflex thresholds were evaluated for associations with major alterations in swallowing safety (pharyngeal residues, penetration, and aspiration). We evaluated the discriminative capacity of the LPMS test using ROC curves and the area under the curve (AUC–ROC) and its relationship with the eight-point penetration–aspiration scale (PAS) using the Spearman’s ρ correlation coefficient (SCC). We found a positive correlation between the PAS and LART (SCC 0.47; P < 0.001), CRT (SCC 0.46; P < 0.001) and GRT (SCC 0.34; P = 0.002). The AUC–ROC values for detecting a PAS ≥7 were as follows: LART, 0.83 (P < 0.0001); CRT, 0.79 (P < 0.0001); GRT, 0.72 (P < 0.0001). In this study, the LPEER showed good accuracy for evaluating LPMS.

	abstract = {Hydrocarbon pipelines are exposed to hazards from natural processes, which may affect their integrity and trigger processes that have consequences on the environment. Among the natural hazards are the effects of the earthquakes, the neotectonic activity, the volcanism, the weathering of soils and rocks, the landslides, the flows or avalanches of mud or debris, the processes related to sediment transport such as the erosion, the scour by streams, the floods and the sloughing due to rains. Those processes are sometimes related to each other, e.g. the earthquakes can produce slides, or movement of geological faults, or soil liquefaction; the rain can trigger landslides and can cause avalanches and mudslides or debris flow; the volcanic eruptions can originate landslides and avalanches, or pyroclastic flows. Human activities can also induce or accelerate "natural" processes that affect the integrity of the pipelines. The strength and stiffness of the pipelines allow them to tolerate the effects of natural hazards for some period of time. The amount of time depends on the strength and deformability, the stress state, the age, the conditions of installation and operation of the pipelines and their geometric arrangement with regard to the hazardous processes. In the programs for pipeline integrity management, the risk is defined as a function that relates the probability of the pipeline rupture and the consequences of the failure. However, some people define risk as the summation of the indicators of probability and consequences, such as a RAM matrix. Others define the risk as the product of the probability of failure times the cost of the consequences, while the overall function used to evaluate the rupture probability of a pipeline facing hazards considered in the ASME b31.8 S standard includes all the elements involved in the failure process. In that standard, for the specific analysis of natural hazards, it is proposed that the function is separated in the two following principal elements: the probability of occurrence of the threatening process (hazard) and the pipeline's capacity to tolerate it. In this paper a general function is proposed, which is the product of the probability of occurrence of the threatening process, the vulnerability of the pipeline (expressed as the fraction of the potential damage the pipe can undergo), and the consequences of the pipeline failure (represented in the summation of the costs of the spilled product, its collection, the pipeline repair and the damages made by the rupture). © Copyright 2017 ASME.},

The models described allow performing optimization of the design and operation of power systems considering aspects as renewable energies and its related variability, distributed generation and micro grids, demand-site management and energy storage systems. Conclusions point out that several of the models recently formulated need to be validated with real data and large-scale systems tests. Moreover, demand-site management and micro grids are aspects that lack of the development of complete optimal power flow models. Finally, the accurate forecasting of stochastic variables is necessary to accomplish a better adaptation of models to real behavior of the power system. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.},

	abstract = {Colombia is a country with a huge agricultural potential, thanks to its size and geography diversity. Unfortunately, it is far from using it efficiently: 65% of its farmland is either unused or underused due to political problems. Furthermore, vast of Colombian agriculture is characterized - when compared with other countries - by low levels of productivity, due to the lack of good farming practices and technologies. The new political framework created by the recently signed peace agreement in this country opens new opportunities to increase its agricultural vocation. However, a lot of work is still required in this country to improve the synergy between academia, industry, agricultural experts, and farmers towards improving productivity in this field. Advances in smart-farming technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data/Data Analytics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), bring a great opportunity to contribute to such synergy. These technologies allow not only to collect and analyze data directly from the crops in real time, but to extract new knowledge from it. Furthermore, this new knowledge, combined with the knowledge of local experts, could become the core of future technical assistance and decision support systems tools for countries with a great variety of soils and tropical floors such as Colombia. Motivated by these issues, this paper proposes an extension to Thingsboard, a popular open-source IoT platform. This extended version aims to be the core of a cloud-based Smart Farming platform that will concentrate sensors, a decision support system, and a configuration of remotely controlled and autonomous devices (e.g. water dispensers, rovers or drones). The architecture of the platform is described in detail and then showcased in a scenario with simulated sensors. In such scenario early warnings of an important plant pathogen in Colombia are generated by data analytics, and actions on third-party devices are dispatched in consequence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

CNTF were made by means the Catalytic Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique at 700° C using a Nickel, Copper and Aluminum (NiCuAl) catalyst with a Cu/Ni molar relation of 0,33. In order to properly assess HMA-2 performance, three different mixtures were analyzed: 1) HMA-2 modified with purified CNTF; 2) HMA-2 modified with non-purified CNTF and, 3) a Conventional HMA-2 (control). Samples manufactured in accordance with the Marshall Mix Design were tested in the laboratory to study rutting, resilient modulus (Mr) and fatigue. In addition to the aforementioned dynamic characterization, the effect of CNTF purification on the asphalt mixture’s mechanical properties was analyzed. In short, a comparative study was designed to determine whether or not CNTF should be purified before introduction into the HMA-2. This investigation responds to the growing demand for economical materials capable of withstanding traffic loads while simultaneously enhancing pavement durability and mechanical properties. Although purified CNTF increased HMA-2 stiffness and elastic modulus, non-purified CNTF increased the asphalt mixture’s elastic modulus without considerable increases in stiffness. Thus, the latter modification is deemed to help address fatigue-related issues and improve the long-term durability of flexible pavements. © 2017, Revista Ingenieria e Investigacion - Editorial Board.

An interesting perspective for the development of security solutions is the use of an event management approach, knowing that an event may become an incident when an information asset is affected under certain circumstances. The paper at hand proposes a security solution based on the management of security events within IoT scenarios in order to accurately identify suspicious activities. To this end, different vulnerabilities found in IoT devices are described, as well as unique features that make these devices an appealing target for attacks. Finally, three IoT attack scenarios are presented, describing exploited vulnerabilities, security events generated by the attack, and accurate responses that could be launched to help decreasing the impact of the attack on IoT devices. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach is suitable for protecting the IoT ecosystem, giving an adequate protection level to the IoT devices. © 2018 Daniel Díaz López et al.},

The results generated by the proposed algorithm were validated with those of the commercial software Tech MCS Studio of Technaid. The comparison gives a mild difference for cadence and stride time.

	abstract = {Today’s autonomous robots are being used for complex tasks, including space exploration, military applications, and precision agriculture. As the complexity of control architectures increases, reliability of autonomous robots becomes more challenging to guarantee. This paper presents a hybrid control architecture, based on the Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL), for autonomy of wheeled robots running the Robot Operating System (ROS). PLEXIL is a synchronous reactive language developed by NASA for mission critical robotic systems, while ROS is one of the most popular frameworks for robotic middle-ware development. Given the safety-critical nature of spacecraft operations, PLEXIL operational semantics has been mathematically defined, and formal techniques and tools have been developed to automatically analyze plans written in this language. The hybrid control architecture proposed in this paper is showcased in a path tracking scenario using the Husky robot platform via a Gazebo simulation. Thanks to the architecture presented in this paper, all formal analysis techniques and tools currently available to PLEXIL are now available to build reliable plans for ROS-enabled wheeled robots. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Longer and Heavier Vehicles (LHVs) could enhance the competitiveness of countries due to savings in transportation costs. However, the impact that this measure might have on the regional economic and on the transportation network remains unknown, since there is no methodology available to assess it. In this paper, we develop a new methodology based on a Random Utility-Based Multiregional Input–output Model and a road transport network model to assess the impact of allowing LHVs. We applied it to the case of Spain, and we found that allowing LHVs would produce both direct and indirect effects. Real GDP and employment are expected to grow in all the regions, but some of them —the most competitive, most peripheral, and most transport-intensive— will benefit much more than other regions. We also found that the measure would lead to a reduction of vehicles in the network and a reduction of emissions too. The approach designed in this paper provides broad guidance to national governments and other transport-related parties to quantify the impacts of transport policies such as this. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Two repeatable modal frequencies were extracted: 52.54 ± 2.05 Hz and 118.94 ± 2.70 Hz, which were used to update the mechanical properties of the numerical model. The knowledge of these modal characteristics makes it possible to design new equipment that would absorb these specific vibrations and possibly reduce the risk of related diseases in the field of sports and transport. © 2017 by the authors.

SE model consists of 5 rigid segments linked with 5 degrees of freedom driven by 12 muscles. Muscle fascicle length (FL) and active fiber force (AFF) were calculated during simulation of 2 single joint shoulder and elbow movements. RMS errors were calculated between results. Differences between models were smallest for muscle FL (RMSE≤0.0037) and AFF (RMSE≤22.0155). RMS errors were biggest for FL of deltoid posterior muscle (RMSE=0.1165) and for AFF of supraspinatus muscle (RMSE=164.97) during shoulder abduction.

One of the main processes that take place in the WEM are hourly power auctions, were, based on the offers from energy generators, the electrical system operator covers the energy demand of low power level users. However, even though the energy generation utilities are public service companies, great part of the information related to their offering prices during auctions is private or hard to acquire, which makes it hard to fully understand or characterize the energy auction's dynamics. In the need of a tool that eases the short term understanding of the WEM, this article develops a computational algorithm in MATLAB capable of replicating Colombia's power market behaviour in terms of the market clearing price.

	abstract = {Background: Running is the source of repeated shocks which can reach amplitude over 20g during a foot-ground contact generating stress vibration in humans. This study proposes to apply an advanced signal processing method which is the Empirical Modal Decomposition (EMD) to describe the vibration at the tibia after the impact in running. Methods: One participant completed 5 tests at 10 and 14 km/h on a treadmill using Rearfoot strike and Forefoot strike techniques. Accelerometric data were collected at a sampling frequency of 1344 Hz. The sports kinematics and vibrations generated by the impact were dissociated by a reconstruction scheme of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Then, Root Mean Square (RMS) values were computed before and after the EMD. Results: EMD method allows (i) dissociating three phases generated by the runner kinematics and by the foot/ground shock, (ii) to estimate an RMS value generated to the impact (RearFoot, 14km/h: 6m/s2, 10km/h: 4.5m/s2; ForeFoot, 14km/h:11.2m/s2, 10km/h: 8.1m/s2). This value depends on the running technique and on the speed. Conclusion: This study is orientated on the original methodology of the signal treatment.

The structure and composition of the oxide scale were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and conversion electron Mössbauer spectrometry (CEMS). In this study it was found that the oxide layers form duplex structures consisting of Fe and Cr oxides. CEMS spectra are composed of one doublet due to dispersed Fe 3+ in Cr2O3 oxidation layers produced at high temperatures and two magnetic components due to Fe-Cr-Mo alloy substrate and hematite (Fe, Cr)2O3 with lower hyperfine field than pure hematite (52 T). Fe rich oxides are formed at the surface by oxidation at relatively low temperatures of 600 ∘C and 700 ∘C, while Cr rich (Fe, Cr)-oxides are formed in the top surface layers by oxidation at higher than 750 ∘C. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

Consequently, this research empirically explores the organizational antecedents and the implementation of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) practices for a purposeful sample of focal firms in Colombia. A semi-structured qualitative research design is followed. This study contributes to the development of SSCM theory by providing empirical grounds for understanding the nature of these practices and the extent of their implementation in a particular industrial context, as well as by assessing whether and how they affect the focal firms’ competitiveness. Additionally, the main results suggest that environmental and social responsibilities are increasingly important issues for the stakeholders of focal companies in emergent economies. © 2016, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

	abstract = {Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of permanent serious physical disability in childhood. New strategies are needed to help promote, maintain, and rehabilitate the functional capacity of children with severe level of impairment. Overground walking rehabilitation devices appear as an alternative treatment for improving gait performance as well as training natural gait patterns among this population. The main objective of this work is to present a Human-Robot interaction strategy for overground rehabilitation to support novel robotic-based therapies for CP rehabilitation. This strategy is implemented in a new robotic platform named CPWalker. In our approach, legs' kinematics information obtained from a Laser Range Finder (LRF) sensor is used to detect the user's locomotion intentions and drive the robotic platform. The controller continuously adjust robot's velocity to human velocity achieving an adequate robot motion that assists the locomotion at each step. During a preliminary validation we observed that our strategy is able to fast adapt to patients and provide them a stable gait pattern at different speeds. As a result, the proposed controller is able to provide a natural interface between the robotic-platform and the patient. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The comet assay is a commonly used technique in molecular and cell biology fields, for studies in which the DNA damage of a cell is measured. For instance, it is useful to analyze whenever a carcinogenic cell is affected by chemical agents, helping with oncology research. Traditionally, in order to evaluate the damage of a cell, an expert observes the morphology and the intensity (brightness) of the resulting comet. However, taking into account that a large number of images have to be analyzed, this task may demand a lot of time to be done manually. In recent years, the comet assay analysis has been implemented semi-automatically and automatically with the rise of new image processing algorithms. Although these new algorithms reduce the time invested in the image analysis, some problems in comet identification and accurate measure of their components need to be improved. This project aimed to develop an algorithm and an interface, named CometLab, for flexible automatic comet segmentation. Its performance was assessed with a set of images and compared against an open source, available software called OpenComet. It was found that only 1 of the 15 features that were extracted by both algorithms was not statistically correlated (head diameter), meaning that the designed application is suitable; therefore, this research helped to obtain information about the performance of CometLab in comparison to OpenComet, which serves as setpoint for future works in which it would be possible to decide which algorithm is better. © SPIE.

Participants assessed different pictures from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) through the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) technique. EEG data were recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain to observe interhemispheric asymmetries in the alpha and beta bands. The SAM results show differences in the arousal dimension between the two groups of women, suggesting a different interpretation in those with history of IPV. For the valence dimension the results were not conclusive. EEG signals show evidence of asymmetries, varying according to the valence dimension, especially in the frontal area, correlated with the SAM results and IAPS normative values. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In order to ensure a continuous and reliable path for the lateral loads caused by earthquake or wind forces, FRP-strengthened masonry walls that are part of the lateral load resisting system of a building require the joint work of the FRP strengthening to resist tensile stresses in the masonry and anchorage to the boundary structural elements (foundations or beams) to transfer the loads. This article presents the results of an investigation on the assessment of anchorage methods and FRP strengthening configurations for unreinforced masonry (URM) walls subjected to in-plane loads. Fourteen masonry walls were constructed for this experimental program. All of the walls were built with hollow clay bricks, typical of URM structures in Colombia and other parts of the world. The specimens for this investigation included slender and squat walls. The dimensions of the slender walls were 1.20 m. [4 ft] long, 1.90 m. [6.2 ft.] high, and 120 mm [4.8 in.] thick. The dimensions of the squat walls: 2.50 m. [8.2 ft.] long, 1.90 m. [6.2 ft.] high, and 120 mm [4.8 in.] thick. The walls were strengthened using two configurations: (1) Layout 'FT involving horizontal CFRP laminates along on wall side, and vertical CFRP laminates at each wall toe on one side of the wall, and (20 Layout ' X ' involving diagonal CFRP laminates oriented at approximately 45 degrees on one side of the wall. Four anchor systems were evaluated: (1) System 1 (CFRP anchors embedded in the base beam), (2) System 2 (CFRP bonded to the base beam), (3) System 3 (FRP bonded to grout blocks), and (4) System 4 (FRP wrapped around grout blocks). The walls were tested in two series: (1) Series 1 - Monotonie Loading, and (2) Series 2 - Cyclic Loading. The test results demonstrated that Anchor System 4 was the most effective anchorage system. The walls strengthened with Anchor System 4 failed due to rupture of the CFRP laminates wrapped around the grout block. In general, the largest increases in in-plane capacity, when compared to the control walls, were observed in the slender walls.

Consolidation is used to solve producers' and transporters' needs to reduce cost, maximize service level between origin and destination and improve flexibility of multimodal transport. It is caused because of a) Equipment's Consolidation (EC) capacity, b) use of Chassis Truck (CT) for several transport methods, merchandise type and Cargo Unit's (CU) nature. The first objective of this article is to show the nomenclature for different kind of alternatives for transport consolidation, which is proposed based on a previous literature review, where were found Inventory Consolidation Models, Collaboration Strategies, Models for Terminal Optimization, among others; but no inventory and interaction of all possible alternatives of CU, EC, CT in multimodal features which allow a clear and easy identification in decision making. The second objective is the selection of EC using the nomenclature previously proposed with PROMETHEE I, II method and the use of GAIA Graphic (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive AID) under criteria described in Transport Multicriteria Decision Making (TMDM), therefore, a consolidation study case for SC of green coffee is proposed. © IEOM Society International.},

	abstract = {Movement intention (MI) is the mental state in which it is desired to make an action that implies movement. There are certain signals that are directly related with MI; mainly obtained in the primary motor cortex. These signals can be used in a brain-computer interface (BCI). BCIs have a wide variety of applications for the general population, classified in two groups: optimization of conventional neuromuscular performances and enhancement of conventional neuromuscular performances beyond normal capacities. The main goal of this project is to analyze if neural rhythm modulation enhancement could be achieved by practicing, through a BCI based on MI detection, which was designed in a previous study. A six-session experiment was made with eight healthy subjects. Each session was composed by two stages: a training stage and a testing stage, which allowed control of a videogame. The scores in the game were recorded and analyzed. Changes in alpha and beta bands were also analyzed in order to observe if attention could in fact be enhanced. The obtained results were partially satisfactory, as most subjects showed a clear improvement in performance at some point in the trials. As well, the alpha to beta wave ratio of all the tasks was analyzed to observe if there are changes as the experiment progresses. The results are promising, and a different protocol must be implemented to assess the impact of the BCI on the attention span, which can be analyzed with the alpha and beta waves. © 2017 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Objective. Evaluate the change over time of psychosocial risk management for the nursing personnel of an intermediate complexity clinic of Bogota (Colombia). Methods. Descriptive and correlational research performed under the approach of risk management (identification, analysis, assessment and treatment). The psychosocial risk of the nursing personnel was studied through 10-year system dynamics models (with and without the implementation of the policy of good practices on the risk treatment) in two scenarios: when the nursing personnel works shifts of 6 hours (morning or afternoon) and when they work over 12 hours (double shift or night shift). Results. When implementing a policy of good practices on the risk treatment, the double shift scenario shows an improvement among 25% to 88% in the variables of: health, labor motivation, burnout, service level and productivity; as well as in the variables of the organization associated to number of patients, nursing personnel and profit. Likewise, the single shift scenario with good practices improves in all the above-mentioned variables and generates stability on the variables of absenteeism and resignations. Conclusion. The best scenario is the single shift scenario with the application of good practices of risk treatment in comparison with the double shift scenario with good practices, which allows concluding that the good practices have a positive effect on the variables of nursing personnel and on those associated to the organization. © 2017, Facultad de Enfermeria de la Universidad de Antioquia.},

	abstract = {Vibration in cycling has been proved to have undesirable effects over health, comfort and performance of the rider. In this study, 15 participants performed eight 6-min sub-maximal pedalling exercises at a constant power output (150W) and pedalling cadence (80 RPM) being exposed to vibration at different frequencies (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 Hz) or without vibration. Oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), surface EMG activity of seven lower limb muscles (GMax, RF, BF, VM, GAS, SOL and TA) and 3-dimentional accelerations at ankle, knee and hip were measured during the exercises. To analyse the dynamic response, the influence of the pedalling movement was taken into account. The results show that there was not significant influence of vibrations on HR and VO2 during this pedalling exercise. However, muscular activity presents a significant increase with the presence of vibration that is influenced by the frequency, but this increase was very low (< 1%). Also, the dynamic response shows an influence of the frequency as well as an influence of the different parts of the pedalling cycle. Those results help to explain the effects of vibration on the human body and the influence of the rider/bike interaction in those effects. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The study advises that neither long range nor vegetation models are applicable for the considered region, leading to a combined model. The proposed model presents an equilibrium between long range empirical models and forest models where an urban-vegetation index is included to compare the factors between the two components. Results show that the proposed model follows the behaviour found in other studies where lateral wave predominated and presents high accuracy with the measured data. © 2017 European Microwave Association.},

In particular, the purpose of this study is to present and reflect upon an active learning activity that seeks for enhancing students' ability to design a production line, using invention systems kits that recreate what typically happens in a real industrial context. Results of applying a series of measures to evaluate the activity in a pilot group of students show that the activity has a potential to enhance learning about the design and development of a production system.

The mechanical properties evaluated include compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, flexural strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. Two reference materials, portland cement concrete without addition and added with 20% of metakaolin (MK), were used. These tests were performed up to 360 days of curing age.

Understanding the complexity of a market layer may be useful to economists, regulators and also to market participants. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, the resistance of blended concrete containing catalytic cracking residue (FCC) to chloride ion penetration and carbon-ation was examined. FCC was added at the levels of 10%, 20%, and 30% as partial replacement for cement. Concretes with 10% of silica fume (SF), 10% of metakaolin (MK), and without additives were evaluated as reference materials. The rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) performed according to ASTM C1202 standards and an accelerated carbonation test in a climatic chamber under con-trolled conditions (23 °C, 60% RH and 4.0% CO2), were used in order to evaluate the performance of these concretes. Additionally, their compressive strength was determined. The results indicate that binary blends with 10% FCC had similar compressive strength to concrete without additives and had lower chloride permeability. 10% SF and 10% MK exhibited better mechanical behavior and a significant decrease in chloride penetration when compared to 10% FCC. It is noted that there was an increase in concrete carbon-ation when FCC or MK were used as additives. It was also observed that with longer curing time, the samples with and without additives, presented higher resistance to carbonation. The accelerated corrosion test by impressed voltage was also performed to verify the findings and to investigate the characteristics of corrosion using a 3.5% NaCl solution as electrolyte. The mixtures that contained 10% FCC were highly resistant to chloride ion penetration and did not present cracking within the testing period.},

The application of each one of these schemes provided significant improvements regarding the reliability and important economic benefits for the electric utility.

	abstract = {The hot-mix asphalt (HMA) rutting prediction model in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) uses a relationship that includes the effects of mix characteristics only through the resilient strain, which in turn is a function of the dynamic modulus (|E*|) of the mix. However, increasing evidence suggests that the use of |E*| alone may be insufficient to characterize completely the permanent deformation behavior of HMA. In addition to effects already considered by the MEPDG model with |E*|, the effects of mix characteristics on permanent deformation are analyzed with the use of the results of repetitive axial permanent deformation tests from laboratory-compacted HMA specimens. Results of multiple linear regression analysis indicate that binder type, effective binder content, and air void content have significant effects on model parameters for permanent deformation. The potential effects of mix characteristics on these parameters are analyzed with the use of the MEPDG model and an HMA pavement section with four levels of compaction. Scenarios in which the mixture characteristics are incorporated solely by means of |E*| are compared with scenarios in which the effects of air void content and asphalt content are incorporated into the rutting prediction model by adjusting its parameters according to relationships established in the laboratory. Empirical laboratory evidence supports the hypotheses that, regardless of mixture properties, universal values for permanent deformation model parameters do not fully account for mixture-specific contributions to rutting and that other mix characteristics (e.g., air void content) may be needed to supplement |E*| for the appropriate characterization of the permanent deformation of asphalt mixtures.},

Consequently, reclaiming aggregates from C&D ruble would lead to environmental and economical benefits.

	abstract = {This paper introduces significant improvements on a previous published work that addresses complex production scheduling problems using Petri nets (PNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs). The PN model allows a formal representation of the manufacturing system and of the special constraints of this kind of system, while the GA generates a near-optimal schedule through the structure provided by the PN. The corresponding manufacturing system is associated with a flexible job shop environment with features such as the fabrication of multiple parts and precedence relationships between such parts and assembly operations, in which the objective is the minimisation of the total weighted tardiness. As part of the modelling stage, a mixed integer linear programming formulation is proposed for this framework. The fabrication of a chess mould in a Colombian company is used in two ways: to introduce a proposed normalisation operator that improves the results by reducing the search space of the GA and to illustrate the use of PN modelling the special aforementioned constraints as well as the encoding of the chromosome used by the GA. The proposed approach was tested on randomly generated instances, and their performance was measure against optimal solutions or solutions provided by algorithms presented in previous work. The results confirm the relevance of this approach to schedule such complex manufacturing systems. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.},

	abstract = {This chapter dealswith the problem of fault diagnosis for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). The goal is to present two strategies for fault diagnosis that are based, respectively, on the electrical equivalent technical and statistical approaches. The first strategy is carried out in two steps. First, an electrical equivalent model, which could be considered as a unifying approach to fuel cell systems, is established. Second, a technical approach to use the electrical model, for fuel cell system diagnosis, will be introduced. The second strategy is based on information from fuel cell conditions and operation modes. This makes the fault diagnosis procedure simpler and can be achieved by considering probability density functions of cell voltage. In this work, the main failure considered is flooding. To illustrate the performances of the two proposed approaches, experimental validations of themodel and the diagnosis methodology are given. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.},

However, the damaged systems can adapt, recover and be restored or strengthened in given acceptable recovery period for resilient systems. The metrics to evaluate objectively the resilience are still to be developed for several systems such as industrial plants, for instance. In fact, the resilience is intimately depending on both expected damages level and adaptation measures. The mechanical vulnerability is therefore an influent governing parameter. The present paper focuses on the case of industrial tanks and their mechanical vulnerability under tsunamis' effect. The resilience of coastal industrial plants is implicitly investigated by running sensitivity analysis: - Since tsunamis may cause structural failure of the tanks. Several modes of damages are considered, i.e. uplift by buoyancy, rigid overturning, rupture of anchorages or rigid sliding effect, and excessive stress by bending or buckling. - For a wide range of tanks dimensions and filling ratios, the vulnerability and fragility curves are developed and discussed. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes rewriting modulo SMT, a new technique that combines the power of SMT solving, rewriting modulo theories, and model checking. Rewriting modulo SMT is ideally suited to model and analyze infinite-state open systems, i.e., systems that interact with a non-deterministic environment. Such systems exhibit both internal non-determinism, which is proper to the system, and external non-determinism, which is due to the environment. In a reflective formalism, such as rewriting logic, rewriting modulo SMT can be reduced to standard rewriting. Hence, rewriting modulo SMT naturally extends rewriting-based reachability analysis techniques, which are available for closed systems, to open systems. The proposed technique is illustrated with the formal analysis of a real-time system that is beyond the scope of timed-automata methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

Both films were approximately 1.2 ± 0.1 μm thick. The crystallography structures that were evaluated via X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) showed preferential orientations in the Bragg planes VN (200) and HfN (111). The chemical compositions for both films were characterized by EDX. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to study the morphology; the results reveal grain sizes of 78 ± 2 nm for VN and 58 ± 2 nm for HfN and roughness values of 4.2 ± 0.1 nm for VN and 1.5 ± 0.1 nm for HfN films. The electrochemical performance in VN and HfN films deposited onto steel 4140 were studied by Tafel polarization curves and impedance spectroscopy methods (EIS) under contact with sodium chloride at 3.5 wt.% solution, therefore, it was found that the corrosion rate decreased about 95% in VN and 99% for HfN films in relation to uncoated 4140 steel, thus demonstrating, the protecting effect of VN and HfN films under a corrosive environment. © 2013 by ESG.},

Moreover, microstructural analyzes were performed of the grain boundaries by means of metallographic microscope and scanning electron microscope.

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in intensive care is still the process of discontinuing mechanical ventilation, called weaning process. Both an unnecessary delay in the discontinuation process and a weaning trial that is undertaken too early are undesirable. In this study, we analyzed respiratory pattern variability using the respiratory volume signal of patients submitted to two different levels of pressure support ventilation (PSV), prior to withdrawal of the mechanical ventilation. In order to characterize the respiratory pattern, we analyzed the following time series: inspiratory time, expiratory time, breath duration, tidal volume, fractional inspiratory time, mean inspiratory flow and rapid shallow breathing. Several autoregressive modeling techniques were considered: autoregressive models (AR), autoregressive moving average models (ARMA), and autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX). The following classification methods were used: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM). 20 patients on weaning trials from mechanical ventilation were analyzed. The patients, submitted to two different levels of PSV, were classified as low PSV and high PSV. The variability of the respiratory patterns of these patients were analyzed. The most relevant parameters were extracted using the classifiers methods. The best results were obtained with the interquartile range and the final prediction errors of AR, ARMA and ARX models. An accuracy of 95% (93% sensitivity and 90% specificity) was obtained when the interquartile range of the expiratory time and the breath duration time series were used a LDA model. All classifiers showed a good compromise between sensitivity and specificity. © 2013 IEEE.},

The set-up consists of two magnetic trackers and two sensorized gloves that command, respectively, two industrial robots and the mechanical hands with which they are equipped. The basic mapping aspects both at hand and arm level are discussed, as well as the communication issues related with the implementation done based on ROS (Robot Operating System). The risk of collisions and of reaching singular configurations, either internal or due to the workspace limits, is controlled by monitoring the state of the hand-arm system and stoping it when necessary. An automatic re-synchronization procedure allows to resume the teleoperation as soon as the risk has disappeared, and also permits the user to change the mapping when his/her posture becomes uncomfortable. The resulting system allows an intuitive, simple and safe teleoperation of a dual hand-arm robotic system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

The project is divided into two stages: The first one, the development oftheskillssimulation tool, the second is the implementation of the global vision system for a single robot and control strategies. Finally, we evaluate the four basic skills in the simulation tool and with the vision system. We observed a good performance for both the simulation of the strategies and the detection of the robot location with the global visionsystem. Thissystem will allowthe navigation of all robotic agents for collaborative work in the next stages of the project. © Research India Publications.},

	abstract = {The use of hand tools that fit users' characteristics is essential for task productivity and prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in industry. In Colombia, workers in the floriculture industry use a wide range of hand tools in cultivation tasks. However, little is known about the correspondence between the employed tools and hand dimensions of this population. The present article studies the hand anthropometry (HA) of a sample of 120 adult female workers of the Colombian flower industry located in the Bogota plateau. In total thirty-three HA measures were studied. A survey of the tasks and hand tools used in this population was also conducted. Detailed descriptive statistics were estimated for the assessed HA measures; and a comparative statistical analysis with other worker female populations reported in the literature was conducted. We found that the surveyed floriculture workers are systematically using tools with dimensions that do not adequately fit their HA and that may impose unnecessary mechanical loads to the users. HA in the present study population appear to be significantly different from other populations' HA, which suggest the need to promote the acquisition, design or re-design of manual tools specifically thought for this working population. Relevance to industry: Hand anthropometry is a necessary input for tool design that promotes task productivity and workers' health. The detailed HA information presented in this study can be used by tool manufacturers to design tools that are suitable for workers of the Colombian floriculture industry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The mathematical foundation is given in the language of abstract set relations. The infrastructure, which is written in the Maude system, enables the synchronous execution of a set relation provided by the user. By using the infrastructure, algorithm verification techniques such as reachability analysis and model checking, already available in Maude for traditional asynchronous rewriting, are automatically available to synchronous set rewriting. In this way, set-based synchronous languages and systems such as those built from agents, components, or objects can be naturally specified and simulated, and are also amenable to formal verification in the Maude system. The use of the infrastructure and some of its Maude-based verification capabilities are illustrated with an executable operational semantics of the Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL), a synchronous language developed by NASA to support autonomous spacecraft operations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Com-pressive strength and performance under sulfate attack were evaluated. Results showed that concrete with FCC and MK as well as control concrete had similar behavior; however its expansion was higher. In addition, the performance of the two types of concrete (FCC y MK) under sulfate attack was comparable; this could be due to fact that FCC and MK showed similarities regarding of their chemical and mineralogical composition.

The current implementation of Calculational is executable in the Haskell programming language, offering support also for higher order computation and pattern matching. This implementation is available for download as open source code and as a Haskell library too (which can be embedded in other programming languages).

This paper describes the motion planning module of the system devoted to plan a path from the trachea to small peripheral pulmonary lesions, that takes into account the geometry and the kinematic constraints of the bronchoscope. The motion planner output is used to visually and haptically guide the navigation during the virtual exploration using the haptic device.

The approach uses the concept of "principal motion directions" to reduce the dimension of the search space in order to obtain results with a compromise between motion optimality and planning complexity (time). Basically, the work includes the following phases: capturing the human hand workspace using a sensorized glove and mapping it to the mechanical hand workspace, reducing the space dimension by looking for the most relevant principal motion directions, and planning the hand movements using a probabilistic roadmap planner. The approach has been implemented for a four finger anthropomorphic mechanical hand (17 joints with 13 independent degrees of freedom) assembled on an industrial robot (6 independent degrees of freedom), and experimental examples are included to illustrate its validity. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of an application to estimate depth using mobile devices that could help visually impaired people to navigate in everyday sites. The mobile device incorporates a stereo camera system and the application takes advantage of the operating system capabilities, such as parallel computation, hardware configuration, in conjunction with the image processing libraries to implement well known and fast performing algorithms for depth estimation. Each camera is calibrated separately and afterwards a stereo calibration is performed. Depth estimation is calculated using two different algorithms and an evaluation of their performance is presented. The mobile devices handle the computational load fast enough to be able to produce the results within the walk time at normal pace. Depth estimation error is low enough to allow object detection like obstacles, room walls or moving persons. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a stroke rehabilitation (SR) system for the upper limbs, developed as an interactive virtual environment (IVE) based on a commercial 3D vision system (a Microsoft Kinect), a humanoid robot (an Aldebaran's Nao), and devices producing ergonometric signals. In one environment, the rehabilitation routines, developed by specialists, are presented to the patient simultaneously by the humanoid and an avatar inside the IVE. The patient follows the rehabilitation task, while his avatar copies his gestures that are captured by the Kinect 3D vision system. The information of the patient movements, together with the signals obtained from the ergonometric measurement devices, is used also to supervise and to evaluate the rehabilitation progress. The IVE can also present an RGB image of the patient. In another environment, that uses the same base elements, four game routines - Touch the balls 1 and 2, Simon says, and Follow the point - are used for rehabilitation. These environments are designed to create a positive influence in the rehabilitation process, reduce costs, and engage the patient. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Through the combination of various techniques such as unification, narrowing, equationally-defined equality predicates, and SMT solving, InvA achieves a significant degree of automation, verifying automatically many proof obligations. Maude Inductive Theorem Prover (ITP) can be used to discharge the remaining obligations which are not automatically verified by InvA.

	abstract = {Disconnection from mechanical ventilation, called the weaning process, is an additional difficulty in the management of patients in intensive care units (ICU). Unnecessary delays in the discontinuation process and a weaning trial that is undertaken too early are undesirable. In this study, we propose an extubation index based on the power of the respiratory flow signal (Pi). A total of 132 patients on weaning trials were studied: 94 patients with successful trials (group S) and 38 patients who failed to maintain spontaneous breathing and were reconnected (group F). The respiratory flow signals were processed considering the following three stages: a) zero crossing detection of the inspiratory phase, b) inflection point detection of the flow curve during the inspiratory phase, and c) calculation of the signal power on the time instant indicated by the inflection point. The zero crossing detection was performed using an algorithm based on thresholds. The inflection points were marked considering the zero crossing of the second derivative. Finally, the inspiratory power was calculated from the energy contained over the finite time interval (between the instant of zero crossing and the inflection point). The performance of this parameter was evaluated using the following classifiers: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, the classification and regression tree, Naive Bayes, and the support vector machine. The best results were obtained using the Bayesian classifier, which had an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 87%, 90% and 81% respectively. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The system describing time-harmonic motions of a two-layer fluid in the linearised shallow-water approximation is considered. It is assumed that the depth is constant, with a cylindrical protrusion (an underwater ridge) of small height. For obliquely incident waves, the system reduces to a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations. The values of frequency for which wave propagation in the unperturbed system is possible are bounded from below by a cutoff, to the left of which no propagating modes exist. Under the perturbation, a trapped mode appears to the left of the cutoff and, if a certain geometric requirement is imposed upon the shape of the perturbation (for example, if the ridge is a rectangular barrier of certain width), a trapped mode appears whose frequency is embedded in the continuous spectrum. When these geometric conditions are not satisfied, the embedded trapped mode transforms into a complex pole of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the corresponding scattering problem, and the phenomenon of almost total reflection is observed when the frequency coincides with the real part of the pole. Exact formulae for the trapped modes are obtained explicitly in the form of infinite series in powers of the small parameter characterising the perturbation. The results provide a theoretical understanding of analogous phenomena observed numerically in the literature for the full problem for the potentials in a two-layer fluid in the presence of submerged cylinders, and furnish explicit formulae for the frequencies at which total reflection occurs and the trapped modes exist. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

The objective is to select a subset of depots to open from a set of candidates, the inventory policies for a two-echelon system, and the set of routes to perform distribution from the upper echelon to the next by a homogeneous fleet of vehicles over a finite planning horizon considering deterministic demand. To solve the problem, a partition is proposed using a Dantzig-Wolfe formulation on the routing variables. A hybridization between column generation, Lagrangian relaxation, and local search is presented within a heuristic procedure. Results demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to compute high quality solutions and empirically estimate the improvement in the cost function of the proposed model at up to 9% compared to the sequential approach. Furthermore, the suggested pricing problem is a new variant of the shortest path problem with applications in urban transportation and telecommunications. © 2014 The Authors.},

The approach is validated using real data from the first semester of year 2012. Results show that the proposed approach obtains a better utilization of classrooms satisfying both hard and soft constraints of the original problem. A sensitivity analysis is finally carried out, in which it was possible to verify the possibility of reducing both the number of classrooms to be assigned and the number of course groups. Both analyses allow an increase in teaching resource availability and a reduction of total cost.},

	abstract = {Built-in equality and inequality predicates based on comparison of canonical forms in algebraic specifications are frequently used because they are handy and efficient. However, their use places algebraic specifications with initial algebra semantics beyond the pale of theorem proving tools based, for example, on explicit or inductionless induction techniques, and of other formal tools for checking key properties such as confluence, termination, and sufficient completeness. Such specifications would instead be amenable to formal analysis if an equationally-defined equality predicate enriching the algebraic data types were to be added to them. Furthermore, having an equationally-defined equality predicate is very useful in its own right, particularly in inductive theorem proving. Is it possible to effectively define a theory transformation EE∼ that extends an algebraic specification E to a specification E∼ having an equationally-defined equality predicate? This paper answers this question in the affirmative for a broad class of order-sorted conditional specifications E that are sort-decreasing, ground confluent, and operationally terminating modulo axioms B and have a subsignature of constructors. The axioms B can consist of associativity, or commutativity, or associativity-commutativity axioms, so that the constructors are free modulo B. We prove that the transformation EE∼ preserves all the just-mentioned properties of E. The transformation has been automated in Maude using reflection and is used as a component in many Maude formal tools. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Improvement of corrosion properties on AISI D3 steel surfaces coated with [CrN/AlN] n multilayered system deposited for various periods (Λ) via magnetron sputtering has been studied in this work exhaustively. For practical effects compared were the latter properties with CrN and AlN single layers deposited with the same conditions as the multilayered systems. The coatings were characterized in terms of crystal phase; chemical composition, micro-structural, and electrochemical properties by x-ray diffractometry, energy dispersive x-ray, Fourier transforming infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Tafel polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Corrosion evolution was observed via optical microscopy. Results from x-ray diffractometry analysis revealed that the crystal structure of [CrN/AlN] n multilayered coatings has an NaCl-type lattice structure and hexagonal structure (wurtzite-type) for CrN and AlN, respectively, i.e., it was made non-isostructural multilayered. The best behavior was obtained by the multilayered period: Λ = 60 nm (50 bilayers), showing the maximum corrosion resistance (polarization resistance of 1.18 KΩ, and corrosion rate of 1.02 mpy). Those results indicated an improvement of anticorrosive properties, compared to the CrN/AlN multilayer system with 1 bilayer at 98 and 80%, respectively. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance of steel AISI D3 is improved beyond 90%. These improvement effects in multilayered coatings could be attributed to the number of interfaces that act as obstacles for the inward and outward diffusions of ion species, generating an increment in the energy or potential required for translating the corrosive ions across the coating/substrate interface. Moreover, the interface systems affect the means free path on the ions toward the metallic substrate, due to the decreasing of the defects presented in the multilayered coatings. © 2010 ASM International.},

To cope with this problem, this paper presents a novel importance sampling method based on the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to enlarge the probability of finding collision-free samples in these difficult regions of the configuration space with low clearance. By using collision-free samples near the goal, PCA is periodically applied in order to obtain a sampling volume near the goal that better covers the free space, improving the efficiency of sampling-based path planning methods. The approach has been tested with success on a hand-arm robotic system composed of a four-finger anthropomorphic mechanical hand (17 joints with 13 independent degrees of freedom) and an industrial robot (6 independent degrees of freedom). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The respiratory pattern of each patient was characterized through the following time series: inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing cycle duration (TTot), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory fraction (TI/TTot), half inspired flow (V T/TI), and rapid shallow index (f/VT), where is respiratory rate. Using techniques as autoregressive models (AR), autoregressive moving average models (ARMA) and autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX), the most relevant parameters of the respiratory pattern were obtained. We proposed the evaluation of these parameters using classifiers as logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and classification and regression tree (CART) to discriminate between patients from groups S, F and R.

	abstract = {The logic of E.W. Dijkstra and C.S. Scholten has been shown to be useful in program correctness proofs and has attracted a substantial following in research, teaching, and programming. However, there is confusion regarding this logic to the point in which, for some time, it was not considered a logic, as logicians use the word. The main objections arise from the fact that: (i) symbolic manipulations seem to be based on the meaning of the terms involved, and (ii) some notation and the proof style of the logic are different, to some extent, from those found in the traditional use of logic. This paper presents the Dijkstra-Scholten logic as a formal system, and explains its proof-theoretic foundations as a formal system, thus avoiding any confusion regarding term manipulation, notation, and proof style. The formal system is shown to be sound and complete, mainly, by using rewriting and narrowing based decision and semi-decision procedures for, respectively, propositional and first-order logic previously developed by C. Rocha and J. Meseguer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an integrated probabilistic framework that deals with the industrial accidents and domino effects that may occur in an industrial plant. The particular case of tsunamis is detailed in the present paper: simplified models for the inundations depths and run-ups as well as their mechanical effects on industrial tanks. The initial accident may be caused by severe service conditions in any of the tanks either under or at atmospheric pressure, or triggered by a natural hazard such as earthquake, tsunami or extreme floods for instance. This initial event generates, in general, a set of structural fragments, a fire ball, a blast wave as well as critical losses of containment (liquid and gas release and loss). The surrounding facilities may suffer serious damages and may also be a new source of accident and explosion generating afterwards a new sequence of structural fragments, fire ball, blast wave and confinement loss. The structural fragments, the blast wave form and the features of the fire ball can be described following database and feedback collected from past accidents. The surrounding tanks might be under or at atmospheric pressure, and might be buried or not, or protected by physical barriers such as walls. The vulnerability of the potential targets should therefore be investigated in order to assess the risk of propagation of the accidents since cascading sequences of accidents, explosions and fires may take place within the industrial plant, giving rise to the domino effect that threatens any industrial plant. The present research describes the risk of domino effect occurrence. The methodology is developed so that it can be operational and valid for any industrial site. It is supposed to be valid for a set of sizes, forms and kinds of tanks as well as a given geometric disposal on the industrial site. The interaction and the behavior of the targets affected or impacted by the first explosion effects should be described thanks to adequate simplified or sophisticated mechanical models: perforation and penetration of metal fragments when they impact surrounding tanks, as well as global failure such as overturning, buckling, excessive bending or shear effects, etc. The vulnerability analysis is detailed for the case of tanks under the mechanical effects generated by tsunamis. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The approach strongly supports the concept that changes in transport costs derived from the LHV allowance as well as the economic structure of regions have direct and indirect effects on the economy and on the transportation system. Results show that the introduction of LHVs might reduce prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services in the regions of Spain and would also lead to a reduction in the regional CPI. In addition, the magnitude and extent of changes in the transportation system are estimated by using the commodity-based structure of the approach to identify the effect of traffic changes on traffic flows and on pollutant emissions over the whole network.},

The erosion-corrosion experiments were performed in a test machine in which the impingement velocity, impact angle, concentration of solids and pH of the solution were controlled. Polarization curves were simultaneously obtained to correlate the electrochemical effects to the erosive wear mechanisms. The slurry used consists of silica particles suspended in a mixture of acid solution and 3.5% NaCl, with a pH value of 5.6. Electrochemical results showed the best corrosion resistance for steel coated with CrN/AlN system deposited with 50 bilayer. Additionally, the surface analysis by SEM micrograph revealed formation of cracks in CrN/AlN multilayers coating and plastic deformation in both steel substrates (AISI D3 steel and 304 stainless steel), especially when the mean impact angle is a critical value of 90°. Measurements of critical and passive current densities showed that the behavior of coated materials differed depending on the substrate that is used. Nonetheless, in a general way, by increasing the impact angle and by changing its incidence from normal to grazing, it led to an improved resistance to erosion-corrosion processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the main challenges of this type of platform, assuming a relatively large population continuously transmitting their signals, is to guarantee good response times for all system's stakeholders (doctors, family, etc.), which is not always possible with the application models that have been traditionally used to build most of services that reside on the Web. This article describes an alternative software architecture proposed for the backend of such telemedicine system, which considers the non-blocking and actor-based programming models, as an alternative to the multi-thread model, and as a mean to simplify such system's scalability. © 2015 IEEE.},

Two steel bars were inserted in each specimen; they act as working electrode and a graphite electrode at the center of the specimen acts as auxiliary electrode. The environments in which were subjected each concrete were distilled water and water with 3.5 % contents of sodium chloride (NaCl) in weight simulating an aggressive environment. The behavior of the steel was monitored electrochemically by the techniques of linear polarization resistance (LPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After a six-month exposure under normal and aggressive conditions, the specimens were analyzed using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique with the purpose to study in detail the concrete-steel interphase establishing the corrosion products formed during the study. It can be concluded of the electrochemical study that the specimens subjected to NaCl generate a performance status front the specimens subjected to distilled water which have a displacement towards passive corrosion zones. © 2013 by ESG.},

This entails several requirements, like the definition of a proper mapping between workspaces, the need to avoid collisions of the teleoperated robot with the environment, and the use of the inverse kinematics and of a procedure to correctly manage the passing through singularities. Within a bilateral teleoperation framework to teleoperate an industrial robot with a desktop haptic device, the present work proposes a guiding system based on path planning techniques to cope with these issues. The proposed system also includes a reactive behavior to cope with the potential collisions with obstacles. Teleoperation tests on virtual and real scenarios are included to validate the approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a case study on the formal specification of a cache coherence protocol and the verification of some of its safety properties. Cache coherence refers to the consistency between the contents of a memory resource shared by many processes, that can have read and write access, and each local copy of the memory contents. The protocol presented in this paper is based on the ESI standard in which a central controller can grant exclusive and shared access to the memory, and also invalidate access to the memory. The formal specification of the protocol is presented as a rewriting logic theory and it is fully executable in the Maude system. The safety properties presented in this paper are linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas expressing invariants about mutual exclusion among the processes accessing the shared memory resource. By using Maude's search functionality and LTL model checker, some of these invariants can be proved automatically for a finite number of processes. This paper also presents an initial exploration on the mechanical verification of an invariant for any number of processes by means of deductive techniques based on inductive reasoning. © 2015 IEEE.},

The model included considerations such as uncertain procurement, stochastic inventories in plants, production scales, supply-production-distribution capacities, particular distribution-production infrastructure, locationallocation considerations, stochastic demand, and BOM. Additionally, the models detail optimal helicopter operation by considering each period's trip frequency during the planning horizon. Finally, a sensibility analysis of the way in which parameters variations affect overall costs is presented.

The multilayers were evaluated against the corrosion-erosion synergy in a solution composed by 3% NaCl and silica. The electrochemical characterization was performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. After the mechanic and electrochemical tests the surface was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. By performance analysis it was observed that the material with higher synergic effect was the substrate. It is also shown that by increasing the bilayers in the system titanium nitride/zirconium nitride the corrosive phenomenon controls the material deterioration.},

XRD results showed a preferential growth in the FCC (111) crystal structure for [TiCN/TiNbCN]n multilayered coatings [1]. In this work was obtained the maximum corrosion resistance for the coating with (Λ) equal to 15 nm, corresponding to n = 200 bilayers. The polarization resistance and corrosion rate were around 8.6 kOhm·cm2 and 7.59·10-4 mmy, these values were 8.6 and 0.001 times higher, respectively, than that uncoated 4140 steel substrate (1.0 KOhm and 0.57 mmy). The improvement of the electrochemical behavior of the 4140 covered with this TiCN/TiNbCN multilayered system can be attributed to the presence of several interfaces that offers resistance of Cl- ions diffusion from the electrolyte toward the steel surface. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Many optimization problems in engineering require coupling a mathematical programming process to a numerical simulation. When the latter is non-linear, the resulting computer time may become unaffordably large because three sequential procedures are nested: the outer loop is associated to the optimization process, the middle one corresponds to the time marching scheme and the innermost loop is required for solving iteratively the non-linear system of equations at each time step. We propose four techniques for reducing CPU time. First, derive the initial values of state variables at each time (innermost loop) from those computed at the previous optimization iteration (outermost loop). Second, select time increment on the basis of those used for the previous optimization iteration. Third, define convergence criteria for the simulation problem on the basis of the optimization process, so that they are only as stringent as really needed. Finally, computations associated to the optimization are shown to be greatly reduced by adopting Newton-Raphson, or a variant, for solving the simulation problem. The effectiveness of these techniques is illustrated through application to three examples involving automatic calibration of non-linear groundwater flow problems. The total number of iterations is reduced by a factor ranging between 1-7 and 4-6. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Through a simple mathematical analysis, we describe a mechanical system that exhibits some features related to more advanced topics in physics and that involves a complex mathematical structure. The system consists of two beads constrained to slide along a hoop and attached to each other through a spring. When the hoop rotates about a fixed axis, the spring-beads system will change its equilibrium position as a function of the angular velocity. This system is shown as an instructive exercise to introduce the Lagrangian method in analytical mechanics, where two different regions of symmetry separated by a critical point analogous to a second-order transition are found, resembling the behaviour of some thermodynamics systems. We even show how the competitive balance between the rotational dynamics and the interaction of the spring behaves in the same way as the balance between temperature and the spin interaction in ferromagnetic systems, which provides some insights about the physical sense of concepts such as spontaneous symmetry breaking, phase transitions, parameter of order and critical exponents. In addition, the gravitational potential act as an external force that causes explicit symmetry breaking where the differences between spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking is emphasized. We also found a chaotic behaviour near the critical point. Through a demonstrative device we perform some qualitative observations that describe important features of the system. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The paper deals with the problem of motion planning of anthropomorphic mechanical hands avoiding collisions. The proposed approach tries to mimic the real human hand motions, but reducing the dimension of the search space in order to obtain results as a compromise between motion optimality and planning complexity (time) by means of the concept of principal motion directions. Basically, the work includes the following phases: capturing the human hand workspace using a sensorized glove and mapping it to the mechanical hand workspace, reducing the space dimension by looking for the most relevant principal motion directions, and planning the hand movements using a sampling-based roadmap planner. The approach has been implemented for a four finger anthropomorphic mechanical hand, and some examples are included to illustrate its validity. © 2009 IEEE.},

In the first project, several manufactured fine aggregates (MFA) and one natural sand were used for mortar and concrete mixtures, without chemical admixtures. Generally, concrete with MFA was suffer and less workable than concrete with natural sand, but in most cases MFA resulted in higher compressive and flexural strengths, higher resistance to chloride penetration, and higher abrasion resistance. In the second project, five aggregates with varied shape and texture were used to make concrete with microfines, chemical admixtures, and supplementary cementing materials. Significant variations due to the combined effect of shape and texture of aggregate, grading, and the type and amount of microfines were found. It was also found that chemical admixtures and cementing materials can be used to enhance workability of concrete with high microfines. Copyright © 2006, American Concrete Institute.

These constraints may be imposed by the kinematic structure of the actuation system, by the task specification, or provided by a human user as an intuitive way to include problem knowledge to the planner. The method has been implemented and tested on a probabilistic roadmap planner giving promising results. A variant using a deterministic sampling source is also reported. © 2009 IEEE.},

The sexual carreer of a man (woman) is thought to be a succession of k(m) partnerships, and a multitype Galton-Watson process is defined, in which the objects are infections and the types are related to the ordinal number of the partnership during which a person has acquired the infection. Contrary to multitype models in which the types are not age-related in some sense, this process contains at least two singular types, namely infections acquired in the last partnership of a man or a woman. The criticality parameter of this branching process is the epidemic threshold parameter R0. In the case k=m an epidemic is impossible, however large k may be, if the difference between the ordinal numbers of the partners in a pair is never > 1. When the frequency of pairs in which this difference is ≥ 2 increases, then R0 increases. This is demonstrated for the cases k=m=3 and k=4, m=3. The formulae obtained show also the joint influence of the mixing pattern and of variable infectivity. The result for the case of uniform mixing implies that a formula of May and Anderson (1987) is an approximation for k and m large. © Springer-Verlag 2003.},

The irreversibility lines determined from zero field cooling and field cooled cooling magnetoresistance and magnetization experiments are coincident and show a behavior which is typical of the spin glass systems. The Hall effect is hole-like and shows a sign reversal in temperatures nearly below Tc. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Matrix diffusion has become widely recognized as an important transport mechanism. Unfortunately, accounting for matrix diffusion complicates solute-transport simulations. This problem has led to simplified formulations, partly motivated by the solution method. As a result, some confusion has been generated about how to properly pose the problem. One of the objectives of this work is to find some unity among existing formulations and solution methods. In doing so, some asymptotic properties of matrix diffusion are derived. Specifically, early-time behavior (short tests) depends only on Φm2RmDm/Lm 2, whereas late-time behavior (long tracer tests) depends only on ΦmRm, and not on matrix diffusion coefficient or block size and shape. The latter is always true for mean arrival time. These properties help in: (a) analyzing the qualitative behavior of matrix diffusion; (b) explaining one paradox of solute transport through fractured rocks (the apparent dependence of porosity on travel time); (c) discriminating between matrix diffusion and other problems (such as kinetic sorption or heterogeneity); and (d) describing identifiability problems and ways to overcome them.},

	abstract = {Dijkstra and Scholten have proposed a formalization of classical predicate logic on a novel deductive system as an alternative to Hilbert's style of proof and Gentzen's deductive systems. In this context we call it CED (Calculus of Equational Deduction). This deductive method promotes logical equivalence over implication and shows that there are easy ways to prove predicate formulas without the introduction of hypotheses or metamathematical tools such as the deduction theorem. Moreover, syntactic considerations (in Dijkstra's words, "letting the symbols do the work") have led to the "calculational style," an impressive array of techniques for elegant proof constructions. In this paper, we formalize intuitionistic predicate logic according to CED with similar success. In this system (I-CED), we prove Leibniz's principle for intuitionistic logic and also prove that any (intuitionistic) valid formula of predicate logic can be proved in I-CED. © 2008 by University of Notre Dame.},

This paper describes a system for the automatic extraction of large bodies of text from the Internet as a valuable tool for such learning tasks. A concurrent programming-based, hardware-use optimisation strategy significantly improving extraction performance is also presented. The strategies incorporated into the system for maximising hardware resource exploitation, thereby reducing extraction time are presented, as are extendibility (supporting digital-content formats) and adaptability (regarding how the system cleanses content for obtaining pure natural language samples). The experimental results obtained after processing one of the biggest Spanish domains on the internet, are presented (i.e. es.wikipedia.org). Such results are used for presenting initial conclusions about the validity and applicability of corpus directly extracted from Internet as morphological or syntactical learning input.},

(13.56 MHz) magnetron sputtering system. The target where made using 4N purity Nb and Al and the growth was performed under a gas mixture of Ar/N2, for different substrate polarization voltages, in order to study the effect of polarization voltage on the crystalline structure and electrochemical properties. Steel 4140 is widely used for fabrication of machines components with hardness between 28 and 38 Rockwell C, however life time of this steel is limited by its low wear and corrosion resistance. The XRD pattern of the sample showed predominantly Bragg peaks for the planes (200) corresponding to FCC phase of the AlNbN, hexagonalδ' NbN phase and hexagonal AlN phase. The FTIR analysis showed vibrational modes associated with NbN, AlN and AlNbN bounds. The steel AISI 4140 with and without AlNbN coating were characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization curves. As a result of this work it was found a voltage polarization dependence on speed corrosion for NbN and Al-Nb-N films.},

The Dijkstra/Scholten equational calculus answers these concerns. Its application has given rise to a style of proving called 'the calculational approach'. Courses on Discrete Mathematics and Algorithm's Design have been taught in Colombian higher education institutions with success for more than 3 years. Recently, we have finished the first phase of a software tool for proof processing using this calculus. The goal pursued for this utility is the support of the learning process in these courses as well as to eventually assist in the program design and derivation process. We present instances of the accomplishments of this teaching methodology in terms of elegant proof style; and evidence of the results on teaching quality. © 2005 IEEE.},

This serious situation has been evidenced by the UK Information Security Breach Survey 2004 and the UK National Hi-Tech Crime Unit's recent report, "Hi-Tech Crime: The Impact On UK Business1". It high-lights that online financial fraud is one of the most serious e-crimes and takes the lion's share of over 60% of e-crime costs, and most of the financial fraud cases are committed by authorised insiders. Authorised insiders can more easily break the security barrier of a bank or a financial institution due to their operating privileges on the banking automated systems. Failure to detect such cases promptly can lead to (sometimes huge) financial loses and damage the reputation of financial institutions. This paper introduces a real-time fraud detection solution - the Transaction Authentication Service (TAS) - to tackle the problem of transaction manipulation by authorised insiders. The paper also introduces an important building block used in the design of TAS, Automated Banking Certificates (ABCs). © IFCA/Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

	abstract = {Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) of 8% Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (8YSZ) were deposited on AISI-304 substrates via r.f magnetron sputtering. A buffer layer of alumina, Al2O3, was deposited to improve the adhesion of the YSZ monolayer to the substrate. The influence of the Al2O3/8YSZ coating on the electrochemical conductance evolution, CtT, was examined by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements when the steels are exposed to temperatures of 700 and 500 °C for 2, 4, and 6 h. Results indicated that CtT diminished three orders of magnitude, in samples coated with Al2O3/8YSZ with respect to uncoated steel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aggregates are the most widely used building material. Nearly all roadways and a large percentage of other buildings and infrastructure utilize aggregates, the primary component in bases, Portland cement concrete, and asphalt concrete. In the U.S., nearly 3 billion tons of aggregates are produced each year. An increasingly larger percentage of aggregates are obtained by crushing; supplies of natural sands and gravels are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain due to environmental limitations and depletion of resources. Manufactured aggregates include relatively high percentages of microfines, i.e., aggregates smaller than 75-μm that traditionally have been viewed as a waste material. Specifications generally limit the amount of microfines in most aggregate applications. Considerable research has been conducted with the objective of demonstrating that higher amounts of microfines can be used to produce quality building materials. This presentation will focus on applications to Portland cement concrete. Results of research will be presented showing how aggregates with high microfine contents can be optimized for use in concrete; the results of strength and durability properties of high fines concrete will be compared to traditional concretes made with natural sands. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {We prove a relatively simple inductive theorem (analogous to Floyd and Dijkstra's Invariance Theorem for iterative programs) to verify the correctness of an ample class of non-deterministic general recursive programs. This result is based on Hoare and Jifeng's relational semantics. By considering the structure of its code and specification, we propose regularity conditions on the predicate transformer associated to the fixed-point equation of a general (non deterministic) recursive program to prove it correct by induction on a well founded ordering of a covering of the domain of its corresponding input-output relation. All fixed point solutions associated to a predicate transformer satisfying these regularity conditions coincide when restricted to the domain of its least fixed point solution. We find these conditions non unduly restrictive, since continuous operators defining deterministic programs as their corresponding least fixed-point solutions must fulfill them. We couch deterministic programs (viewed as least solutions of fixed-point equations) in a restriction of Hoare and Jifeng's P programming language of (partial) finitary relations into the greatest solutions of fixed-point equations expressed in terms of "total finitary" relations of an adequate restriction of their D language.},
